    'PART ONE Chapter 1 It was a bright cold day',
    'in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.',
    'Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his',
    'breast in an effort to escape the vile wind,',
    'slipped quickly through the glass doors of',
    'Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough',
    'to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering',
    'along with him. The hallway smelt of boiled',
    'cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it',
    'a coloured poster, too large for indoor display,',
    'had been tacked to the wall. It depicted',
    'simply an enormous face, more than a metre',
    'wide: the face of a man of about forty-five,',
    'with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly',
    'handsome features. Winston made for the stairs.',
    'It was no use trying the lift. Even at the',
    'best of times it was seldom working, and',
    'at present the electric current was cut off',
    'during daylight hours. It was part of the',
    'economy drive in preparation for Hate Week.',
    'The flat was seven flights up, and Winston,',
    'who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer',
    'above his right ankle, went slowly, resting',
    'several times on the way. On each landing,',
    'opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with',
    'the enormous face gazed from the wall. It',
    'was one of those pictures which are so contrived',
    'that the eyes follow you about when you move.',
    'BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption',
    'beneath it ran. Inside the flat a fruity',
    'voice was reading out a list of figures which',
    'had something to do with the production of',
    'pig-iron. The voice came from an oblong metal',
    'plaque like a dulled mirror which formed',
    'part of the surface of the right-hand wall.',
    'Winston turned a switch and the voice sank',
    'somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable.',
    'The instrument (the telescreen, it was called)',
    'could be dimmed, but there was no way of',
    'shutting it off completely. He moved over',
    'to the window: a smallish, frail figure,',
    'the meagreness of his body merely emphasized',
    'by the blue overalls which were the uniform',
    'of the party. His hair was very fair, his',
    'face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened',
    'by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and',
    'the cold of the winter that had just ended.',
    'Outside, even through the shut window-pane,',
    'the world looked cold. Down in the street',
    'little eddies of wind were whirling dust',
    'and torn paper into spirals, and though the',
    'sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue,',
    'there seemed to be no colour in anything,',
    'except the posters that were plastered everywhere.',
    'The black-moustachio\'d face gazed down from',
    'every commanding corner. There was one on',
    'the house-front immediately opposite. BIG',
    'BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said,',
    'while the dark eyes looked deep into Winston\'s',
    'own. Down at street level another poster,',
    'torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the',
    'wind, alternately covering and uncovering',
    'the single word INGSOC. In the far distance',
    'a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs,',
    'hovered for an instant like a bluebottle,',
    'and darted away again with a curving flight.',
    'It was the police patrol, snooping into people\'s',
    'windows. The patrols did not matter, however.',
    'Only the Thought Police mattered. Behind',
    'Winston\'s back the voice from the telescreen',
    'was still babbling away about pig-iron and',
    'the overfulfilment of the Ninth Three-Year',
    'Plan. The telescreen received and transmitted',
    'simultaneously. Any sound that Winston made,',
    'above the level of a very low whisper, would',
    'be picked up by it, moreover, so long as',
    'he remained within the field of vision which',
    'the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen',
    'as well as heard. There was of course no',
    'way of knowing whether you were being watched',
    'at any given moment. How often, or on what',
    'system, the Thought Police plugged in on',
    'any individual wire was guesswork. It was',
    'even conceivable that they watched everybody',
    'all the time. But at any rate they could',
    'plug in your wire whenever they wanted to.',
    'You had to live, did live, from habit that',
    'became instinct, in the assumption that every',
    'sound you made was overheard, and, except',
    'in darkness, every movement scrutinized.',
    'Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen.',
    'It was safer; though, as he well knew, even',
    'a back can be revealing. A kilometre away',
    'the Ministry of Truth, his place of work,',
    'towered vast and white above the grimy landscape.',
    'This, he thought with a sort of vague distaste,',
    'this was London, chief city of Airstrip One,',
    'itself the third most populous of the provinces',
    'of Oceania. He tried to squeeze out some',
    'childhood memory that should tell him whether',
    'London had always been quite like this. Were',
    'there always these vistas of rotting nineteenth-century',
    'houses, their sides shored up with baulks',
    'of timber, their windows patched with cardboard',
    'and their roofs with corrugated iron, their',
    'crazy garden walls sagging in all directions?',
    'And the bombed sites where the plaster dust',
    'swirled in the air and the willow-herb straggled',
    'over the heaps of rubble; and the places',
    'where the bombs had cleared a larger patch',
    'and there had sprung up sordid colonies of',
    'wooden dwellings like chicken-houses? But',
    'it was no use, he could not remember: nothing',
    'remained of his childhood except a series',
    'of bright-lit tableaux occurring against',
    'no background and mostly unintelligible.',
    'The Ministry of Truth, Minitrue, in Newspeak',
    '[Newspeak was the official language of Oceania.',
    'For an account of its structure and etymology',
    'see Appendix.], was startlingly different',
    'from any other object in sight. It was an',
    'enormous pyramidal structure of glittering',
    'white concrete, soaring up, terrace after',
    'terrace, 300 metres into the air. From where',
    'Winston stood it was just possible to read,',
    'picked out on its white face in elegant lettering,',
    'the three slogans of the Party: WAR IS PEACE',
    'FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH',
    'The Ministry of Truth contained, it was said,',
    'three thousand rooms above ground level,',
    'and corresponding ramifications below. Scattered',
    'about London there were just three other',
    'buildings of similar appearance and size.',
    'So completely did they dwarf the surrounding',
    'architecture that from the roof of Victory',
    'Mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously.',
    'They were the homes of the four Ministries',
    'between which the entire apparatus of government',
    'was divided. The Ministry of Truth, which',
    'concerned itself with news, entertainment,',
    'education, and the fine arts. The Ministry',
    'of Peace, which concerned itself with war.',
    'The Ministry of Love, which maintained law',
    'and order. And the Ministry of Plenty, which',
    'was responsible for economic affairs. Their',
    'names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv,',
    'and Miniplenty. The Ministry of Love was',
    'the really frightening one. There were no',
    'windows in it at all. Winston had never been',
    'inside the Ministry of Love, nor within half',
    'a kilometre of it. It was a place impossible',
    'to enter except on official business, and',
    'then only by penetrating through a maze of',
    'barbed-wire entanglements, steel doors, and',
    'hidden machine-gun nests. Even the streets',
    'leading up to its outer barriers were roamed',
    'by gorilla-faced guards in black uniforms,',
    'armed with jointed truncheons. Winston turned',
    'round abruptly. He had set his features into',
    'the expression of quiet optimism which it',
    'was advisable to wear when facing the telescreen.',
    'He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen.',
    'By leaving the Ministry at this time of day',
    'he had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen,',
    'and he was aware that there was no food in',
    'the kitchen except a hunk of dark-coloured',
    'bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow\'s',
    'breakfast. He took down from the shelf a',
    'bottle of colourless liquid with a plain',
    'white label marked VICTORY GIN. It gave off',
    'a sickly, oily smell, as of Chinese rice-spirit.',
    'Winston poured out nearly a teacupful, nerved',
    'himself for a shock, and gulped it down like',
    'a dose of medicine. Instantly his face turned',
    'scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes.',
    'The stuff was like nitric acid, and moreover,',
    'in swallowing it one had the sensation of',
    'being hit on the back of the head with a',
    'rubber club. The next moment, however, the',
    'burning in his belly died down and the world',
    'began to look more cheerful. He took a cigarette',
    'from a crumpled packet marked VICTORY CIGARETTES',
    'and incautiously held it upright, whereupon',
    'the tobacco fell out on to the floor. With',
    'the next he was more successful. He went',
    'back to the living-room and sat down at a',
    'small table that stood to the left of the',
    'telescreen. From the table drawer he took',
    'out a penholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick,',
    'quarto-sized blank book with a red back and',
    'a marbled cover. For some reason the telescreen',
    'in the living-room was in an unusual position.',
    'Instead of being placed, as was normal, in',
    'the end wall, where it could command the',
    'whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite',
    'the window. To one side of it there was a',
    'shallow alcove in which Winston was now sitting,',
    'and which, when the flats were built, had',
    'probably been intended to hold bookshelves.',
    'By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well',
    'back, Winston was able to remain outside',
    'the range of the telescreen, so far as sight',
    'went. He could be heard, of course, but so',
    'long as he stayed in his present position',
    'he could not be seen. It was partly the unusual',
    'geography of the room that had suggested',
    'to him the thing that he was now about to',
    'do. But it had also been suggested by the',
    'book that he had just taken out of the drawer.',
    'It was a peculiarly beautiful book. Its smooth',
    'creamy paper, a little yellowed by age, was',
    'of a kind that had not been manufactured',
    'for at least forty years past. He could guess,',
    'however, that the book was much older than',
    'that. He had seen it lying in the window',
    'of a frowsy little junk-shop in a slummy',
    'quarter of the town (just what quarter he',
    'did not now remember) and had been stricken',
    'immediately by an overwhelming desire to',
    'possess it. Party members were supposed not',
    'to go into ordinary shops (\'dealing on the',
    'free market\', it was called), but the rule',
    'was not strictly kept, because there were',
    'various things, such as shoelaces and razor',
    'blades, which it was impossible to get hold',
    'of in any other way. He had given a quick',
    'glance up and down the street and then had',
    'slipped inside and bought the book for two',
    'dollars fifty. At the time he was not conscious',
    'of wanting it for any particular purpose.',
    'He had carried it guiltily home in his briefcase.',
    'Even with nothing written in it, it was a',
    'compromising possession. The thing that he',
    'was about to do was to open a diary. This',
    'was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since',
    'there were no longer any laws), but if detected',
    'it was reasonably certain that it would be',
    'punished by death, or at least by twenty-five',
    'years in a forced-labour camp. Winston fitted',
    'a nib into the penholder and sucked it to',
    'get the grease off. The pen was an archaic',
    'instrument, seldom used even for signatures,',
    'and he had procured one, furtively and with',
    'some difficulty, simply because of a feeling',
    'that the beautiful creamy paper deserved',
    'to be written on with a real nib instead',
    'of being scratched with an ink-pencil. Actually',
    'he was not used to writing by hand. Apart',
    'from very short notes, it was usual to dictate',
    'everything into the speak-write which was',
    'of course impossible for his present purpose.',
    'He dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered',
    'for just a second. A tremor had gone through',
    'his bowels. To mark the paper was the decisive',
    'act. In small clumsy letters he wrote: April',
    '4th, 1984. He sat back. A sense of complete',
    'helplessness had descended upon him. To begin',
    'with, he did not know with any certainty',
    'that this was 1984. It must be round about',
    'that date, since he was fairly sure that',
    'his age was thirty-nine, and he believed',
    'that he had been born in 1944 or 1945; but',
    'it was never possible nowadays to pin down',
    'any date within a year or two. For whom,',
    'it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was',
    'he writing this diary? For the future, for',
    'the unborn. His mind hovered for a moment',
    'round the doubtful date on the page, and',
    'then fetched up with a bump against the Newspeak',
    'word DOUBLETHINK. For the first time the',
    'magnitude of what he had undertaken came',
    'home to him. How could you communicate with',
    'the future? It was of its nature impossible.',
    'Either the future would resemble the present,',
    'in which case it would not listen to him:',
    'or it would be different from it, and his',
    'predicament would be meaningless. For some',
    'time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper.',
    'The telescreen had changed over to strident',
    'military music. It was curious that he seemed',
    'not merely to have lost the power of expressing',
    'himself, but even to have forgotten what',
    'it was that he had originally intended to',
    'say. For weeks past he had been making ready',
    'for this moment, and it had never crossed',
    'his mind that anything would be needed except',
    'courage. The actual writing would be easy.',
    'All he had to do was to transfer to paper',
    'the interminable restless monologue that',
    'had been running inside his head, literally',
    'for years. At this moment, however, even',
    'the monologue had dried up. Moreover his',
    'varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably.',
    'He dared not scratch it, because if he did',
    'so it always became inflamed. The seconds',
    'were ticking by. He was conscious of nothing',
    'except the blankness of the page in front',
    'of him, the itching of the skin above his',
    'ankle, the blaring of the music, and a slight',
    'booziness caused by the gin. Suddenly he',
    'began writing in sheer panic, only imperfectly',
    'aware of what he was setting down. His small',
    'but childish handwriting straggled up and',
    'down the page, shedding first its capital',
    'letters and finally even its full stops:',
    'April 4th, 1984. Last night to the flicks.',
    'All war films. One very good one of a ship',
    'full of refugees being bombed somewhere in',
    'the Mediterranean. Audience much amused by',
    'shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim',
    'away with a helicopter after him, first you',
    'saw him wallowing along in the water like',
    'a porpoise, then you saw him through the',
    'helicopters gunsights, then he was full of',
    'holes and the sea round him turned pink and',
    'he sank as suddenly as though the holes had',
    'let in the water, audience shouting with',
    'laughter when he sank. then you saw a lifeboat',
    'full of children with a helicopter hovering',
    'over it. there was a middle-aged woman might',
    'have been a jewess sitting up in the bow',
    'with a little boy about three years old in',
    'her arms. little boy screaming with fright',
    'and hiding his head between her breasts as',
    'if he was trying to burrow right into her',
    'and the woman putting her arms round him',
    'and comforting him although she was blue',
    'with fright herself, all the time covering',
    'him up as much as possible as if she thought',
    'her arms could keep the bullets off him.',
    'then the helicopter planted a 20 kilo bomb',
    'in among them terrific flash and the boat',
    'went all to matchwood. then there was a wonderful',
    'shot of a child\'s arm going up up up right',
    'up into the air a helicopter with a camera',
    'in its nose must have followed it up and',
    'there was a lot of applause from the party',
    'seats but a woman down in the prole part',
    'of the house suddenly started kicking up',
    'a fuss and shouting they didnt oughter of',
    'showed it not in front of kids they didnt',
    'it aint right not in front of kids it aint',
    'until the police turned her turned her out',
    'i dont suppose anything happened to her nobody',
    'cares what the proles say typical prole reaction',
    'they never, ,  Winston stopped writing, partly',
    'because he was suffering from cramp. He did',
    'not know what had made him pour out this',
    'stream of rubbish. But the curious thing',
    'was that while he was doing so a totally',
    'different memory had clarified itself in',
    'his mind, to the point where he almost felt',
    'equal to writing it down. It was, he now',
    'realized, because of this other incident',
    'that he had suddenly decided to come home',
    'and begin the diary today. It had happened',
    'that morning at the Ministry, if anything',
    'so nebulous could be said to happen. It was',
    'nearly eleven hundred, and in the Records',
    'Department, where Winston worked, they were',
    'dragging the chairs out of the cubicles and',
    'grouping them in the centre of the hall opposite',
    'the big telescreen, in preparation for the',
    'Two Minutes Hate. Winston was just taking',
    'his place in one of the middle rows when',
    'two people whom he knew by sight, but had',
    'never spoken to, came unexpectedly into the',
    'room. One of them was a girl whom he often',
    'passed in the corridors. He did not know',
    'her name, but he knew that she worked in',
    'the Fiction Department. Presumably, since',
    'he had sometimes seen her with oily hands',
    'and carrying a spanner, she had some mechanical',
    'job on one of the novel-writing machines.',
    'She was a bold-looking girl, of about twenty-seven,',
    'with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift,',
    'athletic movements. A narrow scarlet sash,',
    'emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, was',
    'wound several times round the waist of her',
    'overalls, just tightly enough to bring out',
    'the shapeliness of her hips. Winston had',
    'disliked her from the very first moment of',
    'seeing her. He knew the reason. It was because',
    'of the atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold',
    'baths and community hikes and general clean-mindedness',
    'which she managed to carry about with her.',
    'He disliked nearly all women, and especially',
    'the young and pretty ones. It was always',
    'the women, and above all the young ones,',
    'who were the most bigoted adherents of the',
    'Party, the swallowers of slogans, the amateur',
    'spies and nosers-out of unorthodoxy. But',
    'this particular girl gave him the impression',
    'of being more dangerous than most. Once when',
    'they passed in the corridor she gave him',
    'a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce',
    'right into him and for a moment had filled',
    'him with black terror. The idea had even',
    'crossed his mind that she might be an agent',
    'of the Thought Police. That, it was true,',
    'was very unlikely. Still, he continued to',
    'feel a peculiar uneasiness, which had fear',
    'mixed up in it as well as hostility, whenever',
    'she was anywhere near him. The other person',
    'was a man named O\'Brien, a member of the',
    'Inner Party and holder of some post so important',
    'and remote that Winston had only a dim idea',
    'of its nature. A momentary hush passed over',
    'the group of people round the chairs as they',
    'saw the black overalls of an Inner Party',
    'member approaching. O\'Brien was a large,',
    'burly man with a thick neck and a coarse,',
    'humorous, brutal face. In spite of his formidable',
    'appearance he had a certain charm of manner.',
    'He had a trick of resettling his spectacles',
    'on his nose which was curiously disarming,',
    'in some indefinable way, curiously civilized.',
    'It was a gesture which, if anyone had still',
    'thought in such terms, might have recalled',
    'an eighteenth-century nobleman offering his',
    'snuffbox. Winston had seen O\'Brien perhaps',
    'a dozen times in almost as many years. He',
    'felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely',
    'because he was intrigued by the contrast',
    'between O\'Brien\'s urbane manner and his prize-fighter\'s',
    'physique. Much more it was because of a secretly',
    'held belief, or perhaps not even a belief,',
    'merely a hope, that O\'Brien\'s political orthodoxy',
    'was not perfect. Something in his face suggested',
    'it irresistibly. And again, perhaps it was',
    'not even unorthodoxy that was written in',
    'his face, but simply intelligence. But at',
    'any rate he had the appearance of being a',
    'person that you could talk to if somehow',
    'you could cheat the telescreen and get him',
    'alone. Winston had never made the smallest',
    'effort to verify this guess: indeed, there',
    'was no way of doing so. At this moment O\'Brien',
    'glanced at his wrist-watch, saw that it was',
    'nearly eleven hundred, and evidently decided',
    'to stay in the Records Department until the',
    'Two Minutes Hate was over. He took a chair',
    'in the same row as Winston, a couple of places',
    'away. A small, sandy-haired woman who worked',
    'in the next cubicle to Winston was between',
    'them. The girl with dark hair was sitting',
    'immediately behind. The next moment a hideous,',
    'grinding speech, as of some monstrous machine',
    'running without oil, burst from the big telescreen',
    'at the end of the room. It was a noise that',
    'set one\'s teeth on edge and bristled the',
    'hair at the back of one\'s neck. The Hate',
    'had started. As usual, the face of Emmanuel',
    'Goldstein, the Enemy of the People, had flashed',
    'on to the screen. There were hisses here',
    'and there among the audience. The little',
    'sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled',
    'fear and disgust. Goldstein was the renegade',
    'and backslider who once, long ago (how long',
    'ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one',
    'of the leading figures of the Party, almost',
    'on a level with Big Brother himself, and',
    'then had engaged in counter-revolutionary',
    'activities, had been condemned to death,',
    'and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared.',
    'The programmes of the Two Minutes Hate varied',
    'from day to day, but there was none in which',
    'Goldstein was not the principal figure. He',
    'was the primal traitor, the earliest defiler',
    'of the Party\'s purity. All subsequent crimes',
    'against the Party, all treacheries, acts',
    'of sabotage, heresies, deviations, sprang',
    'directly out of his teaching. Somewhere or',
    'other he was still alive and hatching his',
    'conspiracies: perhaps somewhere beyond the',
    'sea, under the protection of his foreign',
    'paymasters, perhaps even, so it was occasionally',
    'rumoured, in some hiding-place in Oceania',
    'itself. Winston\'s diaphragm was constricted.',
    'He could never see the face of Goldstein',
    'without a painful mixture of emotions. It',
    'was a lean Jewish face, with a great fuzzy',
    'aureole of white hair and a small goatee',
    'beard, a clever face, and yet somehow inherently',
    'despicable, with a kind of senile silliness',
    'in the long thin nose, near the end of which',
    'a pair of spectacles was perched. It resembled',
    'the face of a sheep, and the voice, too,',
    'had a sheep-like quality. Goldstein was delivering',
    'his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines',
    'of the Party, an attack so exaggerated and',
    'perverse that a child should have been able',
    'to see through it, and yet just plausible',
    'enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling',
    'that other people, less level-headed than',
    'oneself, might be taken in by it. He was',
    'abusing Big Brother, he was denouncing the',
    'dictatorship of the Party, he was demanding',
    'the immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia,',
    'he was advocating freedom of speech, freedom',
    'of the Press, freedom of assembly, freedom',
    'of thought, he was crying hysterically that',
    'the revolution had been betrayed, and all',
    'this in rapid polysyllabic speech which was',
    'a sort of parody of the habitual style of',
    'the orators of the Party, and even contained',
    'Newspeak words: more Newspeak words, indeed,',
    'than any Party member would normally use',
    'in real life. And all the while, lest one',
    'should be in any doubt as to the reality',
    'which Goldstein\'s specious claptrap covered,',
    'behind his head on the telescreen there marched',
    'the endless columns of the Eurasian army,',
    'row after row of solid-looking men with expressionless',
    'Asiatic faces, who swam up to the surface',
    'of the screen and vanished, to be replaced',
    'by others exactly similar. The dull rhythmic',
    'tramp of the soldiers\' boots formed the background',
    'to Goldstein\'s bleating voice. Before the',
    'Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncontrollable',
    'exclamations of rage were breaking out from',
    'half the people in the room. The self-satisfied',
    'sheep-like face on the screen, and the terrifying',
    'power of the Eurasian army behind it, were',
    'too much to be borne: besides, the sight',
    'or even the thought of Goldstein produced',
    'fear and anger automatically. He was an object',
    'of hatred more constant than either Eurasia',
    'or Eastasia, since when Oceania was at war',
    'with one of these Powers it was generally',
    'at peace with the other. But what was strange',
    'was that although Goldstein was hated and',
    'despised by everybody, although every day',
    'and a thousand times a day, on platforms,',
    'on the telescreen, in newspapers, in books,',
    'his theories were refuted, smashed, ridiculed,',
    'held up to the general gaze for the pitiful',
    'rubbish that they were, in spite of all this,',
    'his influence never seemed to grow less.',
    'Always there were fresh dupes waiting to',
    'be seduced by him. A day never passed when',
    'spies and saboteurs acting under his directions',
    'were not unmasked by the Thought Police.',
    'He was the commander of a vast shadowy army,',
    'an underground network of conspirators dedicated',
    'to the overthrow of the State. The Brotherhood,',
    'its name was supposed to be. There were also',
    'whispered stories of a terrible book, a compendium',
    'of all the heresies, of which Goldstein was',
    'the author and which circulated clandestinely',
    'here and there. It was a book without a title.',
    'People referred to it, if at all, simply',
    'as THE BOOK. But one knew of such things',
    'only through vague rumours. Neither the Brotherhood',
    'nor THE BOOK was a subject that any ordinary',
    'Party member would mention if there was a',
    'way of avoiding it. In its second minute',
    'the Hate rose to a frenzy. People were leaping',
    'up and down in their places and shouting',
    'at the tops of their voices in an effort',
    'to drown the maddening bleating voice that',
    'came from the screen. The little sandy-haired',
    'woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth',
    'was opening and shutting like that of a landed',
    'fish. Even O\'Brien\'s heavy face was flushed.',
    'He was sitting very straight in his chair,',
    'his powerful chest swelling and quivering',
    'as though he were standing up to the assault',
    'of a wave. The dark-haired girl behind Winston',
    'had begun crying out \'Swine! Swine! Swine!\'',
    'and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak',
    'dictionary and flung it at the screen. It',
    'struck Goldstein\'s nose and bounced off;',
    'the voice continued inexorably. In a lucid',
    'moment Winston found that he was shouting',
    'with the others and kicking his heel violently',
    'against the rung of his chair. The horrible',
    'thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not',
    'that one was obliged to act a part, but,',
    'on the contrary, that it was impossible to',
    'avoid joining in. Within thirty seconds any',
    'pretence was always unnecessary. A hideous',
    'ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire',
    'to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with',
    'a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the',
    'whole group of people like an electric current,',
    'turning one even against one\'s will into',
    'a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the',
    'rage that one felt was an abstract, undirected',
    'emotion which could be switched from one',
    'object to another like the flame of a blowlamp.',
    'Thus, at one moment Winston\'s hatred was',
    'not turned against Goldstein at all, but,',
    'on the contrary, against Big Brother, the',
    'Party, and the Thought Police; and at such',
    'moments his heart went out to the lonely,',
    'derided heretic on the screen, sole guardian',
    'of truth and sanity in a world of lies. And',
    'yet the very next instant he was at one with',
    'the people about him, and all that was said',
    'of Goldstein seemed to him to be true. At',
    'those moments his secret loathing of Big',
    'Brother changed into adoration, and Big Brother',
    'seemed to tower up, an invincible, fearless',
    'protector, standing like a rock against the',
    'hordes of Asia, and Goldstein, in spite of',
    'his isolation, his helplessness, and the',
    'doubt that hung about his very existence,',
    'seemed like some sinister enchanter, capable',
    'by the mere power of his voice of wrecking',
    'the structure of civilization. It was even',
    'possible, at moments, to switch one\'s hatred',
    'this way or that by a voluntary act. Suddenly,',
    'by the sort of violent effort with which',
    'one wrenches one\'s head away from the pillow',
    'in a nightmare, Winston succeeded in transferring',
    'his hatred from the face on the screen to',
    'the dark-haired girl behind him. Vivid, beautiful',
    'hallucinations flashed through his mind.',
    'He would flog her to death with a rubber',
    'truncheon. He would tie her naked to a stake',
    'and shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian.',
    'He would ravish her and cut her throat at',
    'the moment of climax. Better than before,',
    'moreover, he realized WHY it was that he',
    'hated her. He hated her because she was young',
    'and pretty and sexless, because he wanted',
    'to go to bed with her and would never do',
    'so, because round her sweet supple waist,',
    'which seemed to ask you to encircle it with',
    'your arm, there was only the odious scarlet',
    'sash, aggressive symbol of chastity. The',
    'Hate rose to its climax. The voice of Goldstein',
    'had become an actual sheep\'s bleat, and for',
    'an instant the face changed into that of',
    'a sheep. Then the sheep-face melted into',
    'the figure of a Eurasian soldier who seemed',
    'to be advancing, huge and terrible, his sub-machine',
    'gun roaring, and seeming to spring out of',
    'the surface of the screen, so that some of',
    'the people in the front row actually flinched',
    'backwards in their seats. But in the same',
    'moment, drawing a deep sigh of relief from',
    'everybody, the hostile figure melted into',
    'the face of Big Brother, black-haired, black-moustachio\'d,',
    'full of power and mysterious calm, and so',
    'vast that it almost filled up the screen.',
    'Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying.',
    'It was merely a few words of encouragement,',
    'the sort of words that are uttered in the',
    'din of battle, not distinguishable individually',
    'but restoring confidence by the fact of being',
    'spoken. Then the face of Big Brother faded',
    'away again, and instead the three slogans',
    'of the Party stood out in bold capitals:',
    'WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE',
    'IS STRENGTH But the face of Big Brother seemed',
    'to persist for several seconds on the screen,',
    'as though the impact that it had made on',
    'everyone\'s eyeballs was too vivid to wear',
    'off immediately. The little sandy-haired',
    'woman had flung herself forward over the',
    'back of the chair in front of her. With a',
    'tremulous murmur that sounded like \'My Saviour!\'',
    'she extended her arms towards the screen.',
    'Then she buried her face in her hands. It',
    'was apparent that she was uttering a prayer.',
    'At this moment the entire group of people',
    'broke into a deep, slow, rhythmical chant',
    'of \'B-B!B-B!\', over and over again, very',
    'slowly, with a long pause between the first',
    '\'B\' and the second, a heavy, murmurous sound,',
    'somehow curiously savage, in the background',
    'of which one seemed to hear the stamp of',
    'naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms.',
    'For perhaps as much as thirty seconds they',
    'kept it up. It was a refrain that was often',
    'heard in moments of overwhelming emotion.',
    'Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom',
    'and majesty of Big Brother, but still more',
    'it was an act of self-hypnosis, a deliberate',
    'drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic',
    'noise. Winston\'s entrails seemed to grow',
    'cold. In the Two Minutes Hate he could not',
    'help sharing in the general delirium, but',
    'this sub-human chanting of \'B-B!B-B!\'',
    'always filled him with horror. Of course',
    'he chanted with the rest: it was impossible',
    'to do otherwise. To dissemble your feelings,',
    'to control your face, to do what everyone',
    'else was doing, was an instinctive reaction.',
    'But there was a space of a couple of seconds',
    'during which the expression of his eyes might',
    'conceivably have betrayed him. And it was',
    'exactly at this moment that the significant',
    'thing happened, if, indeed, it did happen.',
    'Momentarily he caught O\'Brien\'s eye. O\'Brien',
    'had stood up. He had taken off his spectacles',
    'and was in the act of resettling them on',
    'his nose with his characteristic gesture.',
    'But there was a fraction of a second when',
    'their eyes met, and for as long as it took',
    'to happen Winston knew, yes, he KNEW!, that',
    'O\'Brien was thinking the same thing as himself.',
    'An unmistakable message had passed. It was',
    'as though their two minds had opened and',
    'the thoughts were flowing from one into the',
    'other through their eyes. \'I am with you,\'',
    'O\'Brien seemed to be saying to him. \'I know',
    'precisely what you are feeling. I know all',
    'about your contempt, your hatred, your disgust.',
    'But don\'t worry, I am on your side!\' And',
    'then the flash of intelligence was gone,',
    'and O\'Brien\'s face was as inscrutable as',
    'everybody else\'s. That was all, and he was',
    'already uncertain whether it had happened.',
    'Such incidents never had any sequel. All',
    'that they did was to keep alive in him the',
    'belief, or hope, that others besides himself',
    'were the enemies of the Party. Perhaps the',
    'rumours of vast underground conspiracies',
    'were true after all, perhaps the Brotherhood',
    'really existed! It was impossible, in spite',
    'of the endless arrests and confessions and',
    'executions, to be sure that the Brotherhood',
    'was not simply a myth. Some days he believed',
    'in it, some days not. There was no evidence,',
    'only fleeting glimpses that might mean anything',
    'or nothing: snatches of overheard conversation,',
    'faint scribbles on lavatory walls, once,',
    'even, when two strangers met, a small movement',
    'of the hand which had looked as though it',
    'might be a signal of recognition. It was',
    'all guesswork: very likely he had imagined',
    'everything. He had gone back to his cubicle',
    'without looking at O\'Brien again. The idea',
    'of following up their momentary contact hardly',
    'crossed his mind. It would have been inconceivably',
    'dangerous even if he had known how to set',
    'about doing it. For a second, two seconds,',
    'they had exchanged an equivocal glance, and',
    'that was the end of the story. But even that',
    'was a memorable event, in the locked loneliness',
    'in which one had to live. Winston roused',
    'himself and sat up straighter. He let out',
    'a belch. The gin was rising from his stomach.',
    'His eyes re-focused on the page. He discovered',
    'that while he sat helplessly musing he had',
    'also been writing, as though by automatic',
    'action. And it was no longer the same cramped,',
    'awkward handwriting as before. His pen had',
    'slid voluptuously over the smooth paper,',
    'printing in large neat capitals,  DOWN WITH',
    'BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH',
    'BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH',
    'BIG BROTHER over and over again, filling',
    'half a page. He could not help feeling a',
    'twinge of panic. It was absurd, since the',
    'writing of those particular words was not',
    'more dangerous than the initial act of opening',
    'the diary, but for a moment he was tempted',
    'to tear out the spoiled pages and abandon',
    'the enterprise altogether. He did not do',
    'so, however, because he knew that it was',
    'useless. Whether he wrote DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER,',
    'or whether he refrained from writing it,',
    'made no difference. Whether he went on with',
    'the diary, or whether he did not go on with',
    'it, made no difference. The Thought Police',
    'would get him just the same. He had committed,',
    'would still have committed, even if he had',
    'never set pen to paper, the essential crime',
    'that contained all others in itself. Thoughtcrime,',
    'they called it. Thoughtcrime was not a thing',
    'that could be concealed for ever. You might',
    'dodge successfully for a while, even for',
    'years, but sooner or later they were bound',
    'to get you. It was always at night, the arrests',
    'invariably happened at night. The sudden',
    'jerk out of sleep, the rough hand shaking',
    'your shoulder, the lights glaring in your',
    'eyes, the ring of hard faces round the bed.',
    'In the vast majority of cases there was no',
    'trial, no report of the arrest. People simply',
    'disappeared, always during the night. Your',
    'name was removed from the registers, every',
    'record of everything you had ever done was',
    'wiped out, your one-time existence was denied',
    'and then forgotten. You were abolished, annihilated:',
    'VAPORIZED was the usual word. For a moment',
    'he was seized by a kind of hysteria. He began',
    'writing in a hurried untidy scrawl: theyll',
    'shoot me i don\'t care theyll shoot me in',
    'the back of the neck i dont care down with',
    'big brother they always shoot you in the',
    'back of the neck i dont care down with big',
    'brother, ,  He sat back in his chair, slightly',
    'ashamed of himself, and laid down the pen.',
    'The next moment he started violently. There',
    'was a knocking at the door. Already! He sat',
    'as still as a mouse, in the futile hope that',
    'whoever it was might go away after a single',
    'attempt. But no, the knocking was repeated.',
    'The worst thing of all would be to delay.',
    'His heart was thumping like a drum, but his',
    'face, from long habit, was probably expressionless.',
    'He got up and moved heavily towards the door.',
    'Chapter 2 As he put his hand to the door-knob',
    'Winston saw that he had left the diary open',
    'on the table. DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER was written',
    'all over it, in letters almost big enough',
    'to be legible across the room. It was an',
    'inconceivably stupid thing to have done.',
    'But, he realized, even in his panic he had',
    'not wanted to smudge the creamy paper by',
    'shutting the book while the ink was wet.',
    'He drew in his breath and opened the door.',
    'Instantly a warm wave of relief flowed through',
    'him. A colourless, crushed-looking woman,',
    'with wispy hair and a lined face, was standing',
    'outside. \'Oh, comrade,\' she began in a dreary,',
    'whining sort of voice, \'I thought I heard',
    'you come in. Do you think you could come',
    'across and have a look at our kitchen sink?',
    'It\'s got blocked up and, , \' It was Mrs Parsons,',
    'the wife of a neighbour on the same floor.',
    '(\'Mrs\' was a word somewhat discountenanced',
    'by the Party, you were supposed to call everyone',
    '\'comrade\', but with some women one used it',
    'instinctively.) She was a woman of about',
    'thirty, but looking much older. One had the',
    'impression that there was dust in the creases',
    'of her face. Winston followed her down the',
    'passage. These amateur repair jobs were an',
    'almost daily irritation. Victory Mansions',
    'were old flats, built in 1930 or thereabouts,',
    'and were falling to pieces. The plaster flaked',
    'constantly from ceilings and walls, the pipes',
    'burst in every hard frost, the roof leaked',
    'whenever there was snow, the heating system',
    'was usually running at half steam when it',
    'was not closed down altogether from motives',
    'of economy. Repairs, except what you could',
    'do for yourself, had to be sanctioned by',
    'remote committees which were liable to hold',
    'up even the mending of a window-pane for',
    'two years. \'Of course it\'s only because Tom',
    'isn\'t home,\' said Mrs Parsons vaguely. The',
    'Parsons\' flat was bigger than Winston\'s,',
    'and dingy in a different way. Everything',
    'had a battered, trampled-on look, as though',
    'the place had just been visited by some large',
    'violent animal. Games impedimenta, hockey-sticks,',
    'boxing-gloves, a burst football, a pair of',
    'sweaty shorts turned inside out, lay all',
    'over the floor, and on the table there was',
    'a litter of dirty dishes and dog-eared exercise-books.',
    'On the walls were scarlet banners of the',
    'Youth League and the Spies, and a full-sized',
    'poster of Big Brother. There was the usual',
    'boiled-cabbage smell, common to the whole',
    'building, but it was shot through by a sharper',
    'reek of sweat, which, one knew this at the',
    'first sniff, though it was hard to say how,',
    'was the sweat of some person not present',
    'at the moment. In another room someone with',
    'a comb and a piece of toilet paper was trying',
    'to keep tune with the military music which',
    'was still issuing from the telescreen. \'It\'s',
    'the children,\' said Mrs Parsons, casting',
    'a half-apprehensive glance at the door. \'They',
    'haven\'t been out today. And of course, ,',
    '\' She had a habit of breaking off her sentences',
    'in the middle. The kitchen sink was full',
    'nearly to the brim with filthy greenish water',
    'which smelt worse than ever of cabbage. Winston',
    'knelt down and examined the angle-joint of',
    'the pipe. He hated using his hands, and he',
    'hated bending down, which was always liable',
    'to start him coughing. Mrs Parsons looked',
    'on helplessly. \'Of course if Tom was home',
    'he\'d put it right in a moment,\' she said.',
    '\'He loves anything like that. He\'s ever so',
    'good with his hands, Tom is.\' Parsons was',
    'Winston\'s fellow-employee at the Ministry',
    'of Truth. He was a fattish but active man',
    'of paralysing stupidity, a mass of imbecile',
    'enthusiasms, one of those completely unquestioning,',
    'devoted drudges on whom, more even than on',
    'the Thought Police, the stability of the',
    'Party depended. At thirty-five he had just',
    'been unwillingly evicted from the Youth League,',
    'and before graduating into the Youth League',
    'he had managed to stay on in the Spies for',
    'a year beyond the statutory age. At the Ministry',
    'he was employed in some subordinate post',
    'for which intelligence was not required,',
    'but on the other hand he was a leading figure',
    'on the Sports Committee and all the other',
    'committees engaged in organizing community',
    'hikes, spontaneous demonstrations, savings',
    'campaigns, and voluntary activities generally.',
    'He would inform you with quiet pride, between',
    'whiffs of his pipe, that he had put in an',
    'appearance at the Community Centre every',
    'evening for the past four years. An overpowering',
    'smell of sweat, a sort of unconscious testimony',
    'to the strenuousness of his life, followed',
    'him about wherever he went, and even remained',
    'behind him after he had gone. \'Have you got',
    'a spanner?\' said Winston, fiddling with the',
    'nut on the angle-joint. \'A spanner,\' said',
    'Mrs Parsons, immediately becoming invertebrate.',
    '\'I don\'t know, I\'m sure. Perhaps the children,',
    ', \' There was a trampling of boots and another',
    'blast on the comb as the children charged',
    'into the living-room. Mrs Parsons brought',
    'the spanner. Winston let out the water and',
    'disgustedly removed the clot of human hair',
    'that had blocked up the pipe. He cleaned',
    'his fingers as best he could in the cold',
    'water from the tap and went back into the',
    'other room. \'Up with your hands!\' yelled',
    'a savage voice. A handsome, tough-looking',
    'boy of nine had popped up from behind the',
    'table and was menacing him with a toy automatic',
    'pistol, while his small sister, about two',
    'years younger, made the same gesture with',
    'a fragment of wood. Both of them were dressed',
    'in the blue shorts, grey shirts, and red',
    'neckerchiefs which were the uniform of the',
    'Spies. Winston raised his hands above his',
    'head, but with an uneasy feeling, so vicious',
    'was the boy\'s demeanour, that it was not',
    'altogether a game. \'You\'re a traitor!\' yelled',
    'the boy. \'You\'re a thought-criminal! You\'re',
    'a Eurasian spy! I\'ll shoot you, I\'ll vaporize',
    'you, I\'ll send you to the salt mines!\' Suddenly',
    'they were both leaping round him, shouting',
    '\'Traitor!\' and \'Thought-criminal!\' the little',
    'girl imitating her brother in every movement.',
    'It was somehow slightly frightening, like',
    'the gambolling of tiger cubs which will soon',
    'grow up into man-eaters. There was a sort',
    'of calculating ferocity in the boy\'s eye,',
    'a quite evident desire to hit or kick Winston',
    'and a consciousness of being very nearly',
    'big enough to do so. It was a good job it',
    'was not a real pistol he was holding, Winston',
    'thought. Mrs Parsons\' eyes flitted nervously',
    'from Winston to the children, and back again.',
    'In the better light of the living-room he',
    'noticed with interest that there actually',
    'was dust in the creases of her face. \'They',
    'do get so noisy,\' she said. \'They\'re disappointed',
    'because they couldn\'t go to see the hanging,',
    'that\'s what it is. I\'m too busy to take them.',
    'and Tom won\'t be back from work in time.\'',
    '\'Why can\'t we go and see the hanging?\' roared',
    'the boy in his huge voice. \'Want to see the',
    'hanging! Want to see the hanging!\' chanted',
    'the little girl, still capering round. Some',
    'Eurasian prisoners, guilty of war crimes,',
    'were to be hanged in the Park that evening,',
    'Winston remembered. This happened about once',
    'a month, and was a popular spectacle. Children',
    'always clamoured to be taken to see it. He',
    'took his leave of Mrs Parsons and made for',
    'the door. But he had not gone six steps down',
    'the passage when something hit the back of',
    'his neck an agonizingly painful blow. It',
    'was as though a red-hot wire had been jabbed',
    'into him. He spun round just in time to see',
    'Mrs Parsons dragging her son back into the',
    'doorway while the boy pocketed a catapult.',
    '\'Goldstein!\' bellowed the boy as the door',
    'closed on him. But what most struck Winston',
    'was the look of helpless fright on the woman\'s',
    'greyish face. Back in the flat he stepped',
    'quickly past the telescreen and sat down',
    'at the table again, still rubbing his neck.',
    'The music from the telescreen had stopped.',
    'Instead, a clipped military voice was reading',
    'out, with a sort of brutal relish, a description',
    'of the armaments of the new Floating Fortress',
    'which had just been anchored between Iceland',
    'and the Faroe Islands. With those children,',
    'he thought, that wretched woman must lead',
    'a life of terror. Another year, two years,',
    'and they would be watching her night and',
    'day for symptoms of unorthodoxy. Nearly all',
    'children nowadays were horrible. What was',
    'worst of all was that by means of such organizations',
    'as the Spies they were systematically turned',
    'into ungovernable little savages, and yet',
    'this produced in them no tendency whatever',
    'to rebel against the discipline of the Party.',
    'On the contrary, they adored the Party and',
    'everything connected with it. The songs,',
    'the processions, the banners, the hiking,',
    'the drilling with dummy rifles, the yelling',
    'of slogans, the worship of Big Brother, it',
    'was all a sort of glorious game to them.',
    'All their ferocity was turned outwards, against',
    'the enemies of the State, against foreigners,',
    'traitors, saboteurs, thought-criminals. It',
    'was almost normal for people over thirty',
    'to be frightened of their own children. And',
    'with good reason, for hardly a week passed',
    'in which \'The Times\' did not carry a paragraph',
    'describing how some eavesdropping little',
    'sneak, \'child hero\' was the phrase generally',
    'used, had overheard some compromising remark',
    'and denounced its parents to the Thought',
    'Police. The sting of the catapult bullet',
    'had worn off. He picked up his pen half-heartedly,',
    'wondering whether he could find something',
    'more to write in the diary. Suddenly he began',
    'thinking of O\'Brien again. Years ago, how',
    'long was it? Seven years it must be, he had',
    'dreamed that he was walking through a pitch-dark',
    'room. And someone sitting to one side of',
    'him had said as he passed: \'We shall meet',
    'in the place where there is no darkness.\'',
    'It was said very quietly, almost casually,',
    'a statement, not a command. He had walked',
    'on without pausing. What was curious was',
    'that at the time, in the dream, the words',
    'had not made much impression on him. It was',
    'only later and by degrees that they had seemed',
    'to take on significance. He could not now',
    'remember whether it was before or after having',
    'the dream that he had seen O\'Brien for the',
    'first time, nor could he remember when he',
    'had first identified the voice as O\'Brien\'s.',
    'But at any rate the identification existed.',
    'It was O\'Brien who had spoken to him out',
    'of the dark. Winston had never been able',
    'to feel sure, even after this morning\'s flash',
    'of the eyes it was still impossible to be',
    'sure whether O\'Brien was a friend or an enemy.',
    'Nor did it even seem to matter greatly. There',
    'was a link of understanding between them,',
    'more important than affection or partisanship.',
    '\'We shall meet in the place where there is',
    'no darkness,\' he had said. Winston did not',
    'know what it meant, only that in some way',
    'or another it would come true. The voice',
    'from the telescreen paused. A trumpet call,',
    'clear and beautiful, floated into the stagnant',
    'air. The voice continued raspingly: \'Attention!',
    'Your attention, please! A newsflash has this',
    'moment arrived from the Malabar front. Our',
    'forces in South India have won a glorious',
    'victory. I am authorized to say that the',
    'action we are now reporting may well bring',
    'the war within measurable distance of its',
    'end. Here is the newsflash, , \' Bad news',
    'coming, thought Winston. And sure enough,',
    'following on a gory description of the annihilation',
    'of a Eurasian army, with stupendous figures',
    'of killed and prisoners, came the announcement',
    'that, as from next week, the chocolate ration',
    'would be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty.',
    'Winston belched again. The gin was wearing',
    'off, leaving a deflated feeling. The telescreen,',
    'perhaps to celebrate the victory, perhaps',
    'to drown the memory of the lost chocolate,',
    'crashed into \'Oceania, \'tis for thee\'. You',
    'were supposed to stand to attention. However,',
    'in his present position he was invisible.',
    '\'Oceania, \'tis for thee\' gave way to lighter',
    'music. Winston walked over to the window,',
    'keeping his back to the telescreen. The day',
    'was still cold and clear. Somewhere far away',
    'a rocket bomb exploded with a dull, reverberating',
    'roar. About twenty or thirty of them a week',
    'were falling on London at present. Down in',
    'the street the wind flapped the torn poster',
    'to and fro, and the word INGSOC fitfully',
    'appeared and vanished. Ingsoc. The sacred',
    'principles of Ingsoc. Newspeak, doublethink,',
    'the mutability of the past. He felt as though',
    'he were wandering in the forests of the sea',
    'bottom, lost in a monstrous world where he',
    'himself was the monster. He was alone. The',
    'past was dead, the future was unimaginable.',
    'What certainty had he that a single human',
    'creature now living was on his side? And',
    'what way of knowing that the dominion of',
    'the Party would not endure FOR EVER? Like',
    'an answer, the three slogans on the white',
    'face of the Ministry of Truth came back to',
    'him: WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE',
    'IS STRENGTH He took a twenty-five cent piece',
    'out of his pocket. There, too, in tiny clear',
    'lettering, the same slogans were inscribed,',
    'and on the other face of the coin the head',
    'of Big Brother. Even from the coin the eyes',
    'pursued you. On coins, on stamps, on the',
    'covers of books, on banners, on posters,',
    'and on the wrappings of a cigarette packet,',
    'everywhere. Always the eyes watching you',
    'and the voice enveloping you. Asleep or awake,',
    'working or eating, indoors or out of doors,',
    'in the bath or in bed, no escape. Nothing',
    'was your own except the few cubic centimetres',
    'inside your skull. The sun had shifted round,',
    'and the myriad windows of the Ministry of',
    'Truth, with the light no longer shining on',
    'them, looked grim as the loopholes of a fortress.',
    'His heart quailed before the enormous pyramidal',
    'shape. It was too strong, it could not be',
    'stormed. A thousand rocket bombs would not',
    'batter it down. He wondered again for whom',
    'he was writing the diary. For the future,',
    'for the past, for an age that might be imaginary.',
    'And in front of him there lay not death but',
    'annihilation. The diary would be reduced',
    'to ashes and himself to vapour. Only the',
    'Thought Police would read what he had written,',
    'before they wiped it out of existence and',
    'out of memory. How could you make appeal',
    'to the future when not a trace of you, not',
    'even an anonymous word scribbled on a piece',
    'of paper, could physically survive? The telescreen',
    'struck fourteen. He must leave in ten minutes.',
    'He had to be back at work by fourteen-thirty.',
    'Curiously, the chiming of the hour seemed',
    'to have put new heart into him. He was a',
    'lonely ghost uttering a truth that nobody',
    'would ever hear. But so long as he uttered',
    'it, in some obscure way the continuity was',
    'not broken. It was not by making yourself',
    'heard but by staying sane that you carried',
    'on the human heritage. He went back to the',
    'table, dipped his pen, and wrote: To the',
    'future or to the past, to a time when thought',
    'is free, when men are different from one',
    'another and do not live alone, to a time',
    'when truth exists and what is done cannot',
    'be undone: From the age of uniformity, from',
    'the age of solitude, from the age of Big',
    'Brother, from the age of doublethink, greetings!',
    'He was already dead, he reflected. It seemed',
    'to him that it was only now, when he had',
    'begun to be able to formulate his thoughts,',
    'that he had taken the decisive step. The',
    'consequences of every act are included in',
    'the act itself. He wrote: Thoughtcrime does',
    'not entail death: thoughtcrime IS death.',
    'Now he had recognized himself as a dead man',
    'it became important to stay alive as long',
    'as possible. Two fingers of his right hand',
    'were inkstained. It was exactly the kind',
    'of detail that might betray you. Some nosing',
    'zealot in the Ministry (a woman, probably:',
    'someone like the little sandy-haired woman',
    'or the dark-haired girl from the Fiction',
    'Department) might start wondering why he',
    'had been writing during the lunch interval,',
    'why he had used an old-fashioned pen, WHAT',
    'he had been writing, and then drop a hint',
    'in the appropriate quarter. He went to the',
    'bathroom and carefully scrubbed the ink away',
    'with the gritty dark-brown soap which rasped',
    'your skin like sandpaper and was therefore',
    'well adapted for this purpose. He put the',
    'diary away in the drawer. It was quite useless',
    'to think of hiding it, but he could at least',
    'make sure whether or not its existence had',
    'been discovered. A hair laid across the page-ends',
    'was too obvious. With the tip of his finger',
    'he picked up an identifiable grain of whitish',
    'dust and deposited it on the corner of the',
    'cover, where it was bound to be shaken off',
    'if the book was moved. Chapter 3 Winston',
    'was dreaming of his mother. He must, he thought,',
    'have been ten or eleven years old when his',
    'mother had disappeared. She was a tall, statuesque,',
    'rather silent woman with slow movements and',
    'magnificent fair hair. His father he remembered',
    'more vaguely as dark and thin, dressed always',
    'in neat dark clothes (Winston remembered',
    'especially the very thin soles of his father\'s',
    'shoes) and wearing spectacles. The two of',
    'them must evidently have been swallowed up',
    'in one of the first great purges of the fifties.',
    'At this moment his mother was sitting in',
    'some place deep down beneath him, with his',
    'young sister in her arms. He did not remember',
    'his sister at all, except as a tiny, feeble',
    'baby, always silent, with large, watchful',
    'eyes. Both of them were looking up at him.',
    'They were down in some subterranean place,',
    'the bottom of a well, for instance, or a',
    'very deep grave, but it was a place which,',
    'already far below him, was itself moving',
    'downwards. They were in the saloon of a sinking',
    'ship, looking up at him through the darkening',
    'water. There was still air in the saloon,',
    'they could still see him and he them, but',
    'all the while they were sinking down, down',
    'into the green waters which in another moment',
    'must hide them from sight for ever. He was',
    'out in the light and air while they were',
    'being sucked down to death, and they were',
    'down there because he was up here. He knew',
    'it and they knew it, and he could see the',
    'knowledge in their faces. There was no reproach',
    'either in their faces or in their hearts,',
    'only the knowledge that they must die in',
    'order that he might remain alive, and that',
    'this was part of the unavoidable order of',
    'things. He could not remember what had happened,',
    'but he knew in his dream that in some way',
    'the lives of his mother and his sister had',
    'been sacrificed to his own. It was one of',
    'those dreams which, while retaining the characteristic',
    'dream scenery, are a continuation of one\'s',
    'intellectual life, and in which one becomes',
    'aware of facts and ideas which still seem',
    'new and valuable after one is awake. The',
    'thing that now suddenly struck Winston was',
    'that his mother\'s death, nearly thirty years',
    'ago, had been tragic and sorrowful in a way',
    'that was no longer possible. Tragedy, he',
    'perceived, belonged to the ancient time,',
    'to a time when there was still privacy, love,',
    'and friendship, and when the members of a',
    'family stood by one another without needing',
    'to know the reason. His mother\'s memory tore',
    'at his heart because she had died loving',
    'him, when he was too young and selfish to',
    'love her in return, and because somehow,',
    'he did not remember how, she had sacrificed',
    'herself to a conception of loyalty that was',
    'private and unalterable. Such things, he',
    'saw, could not happen today. Today there',
    'were fear, hatred, and pain, but no dignity',
    'of emotion, no deep or complex sorrows. All',
    'this he seemed to see in the large eyes of',
    'his mother and his sister, looking up at',
    'him through the green water, hundreds of',
    'fathoms down and still sinking. Suddenly',
    'he was standing on short springy turf, on',
    'a summer evening when the slanting rays of',
    'the sun gilded the ground. The landscape',
    'that he was looking at recurred so often',
    'in his dreams that he was never fully certain',
    'whether or not he had seen it in the real',
    'world. In his waking thoughts he called it',
    'the Golden Country. It was an old, rabbit-bitten',
    'pasture, with a foot-track wandering across',
    'it and a molehill here and there. In the',
    'ragged hedge on the opposite side of the',
    'field the boughs of the elm trees were swaying',
    'very faintly in the breeze, their leaves',
    'just stirring in dense masses like women\'s',
    'hair. Somewhere near at hand, though out',
    'of sight, there was a clear, slow-moving',
    'stream where dace were swimming in the pools',
    'under the willow trees. The girl with dark',
    'hair was coming towards them across the field.',
    'With what seemed a single movement she tore',
    'off her clothes and flung them disdainfully',
    'aside. Her body was white and smooth, but',
    'it aroused no desire in him, indeed he barely',
    'looked at it. What overwhelmed him in that',
    'instant was admiration for the gesture with',
    'which she had thrown her clothes aside. With',
    'its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate',
    'a whole culture, a whole system of thought,',
    'as though Big Brother and the Party and the',
    'Thought Police could all be swept into nothingness',
    'by a single splendid movement of the arm.',
    'That too was a gesture belonging to the ancient',
    'time. Winston woke up with the word \'Shakespeare\'',
    'on his lips. The telescreen was giving forth',
    'an ear-splitting whistle which continued',
    'on the same note for thirty seconds. It was',
    'nought seven fifteen, getting-up time for',
    'office workers. Winston wrenched his body',
    'out of bed, naked, for a member of the Outer',
    'Party received only 3,000 clothing coupons',
    'annually, and a suit of pyjamas was 600,',
    'and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of',
    'shorts that were lying across a chair. The',
    'Physical Jerks would begin in three minutes.',
    'The next moment he was doubled up by a violent',
    'coughing fit which nearly always attacked',
    'him soon after waking up. It emptied his',
    'lungs so completely that he could only begin',
    'breathing again by lying on his back and',
    'taking a series of deep gasps. His veins',
    'had swelled with the effort of the cough,',
    'and the varicose ulcer had started itching.',
    '\'Thirty to forty group!\' yapped a piercing',
    'female voice. \'Thirty to forty group! Take',
    'your places, please. Thirties to forties!\'',
    'Winston sprang to attention in front of the',
    'telescreen, upon which the image of a youngish',
    'woman, scrawny but muscular, dressed in tunic',
    'and gym-shoes, had already appeared. \'Arms',
    'bending and stretching!\' she rapped out.',
    '\'Take your time by me. ONE, two, three, four!',
    'ONE, two, three, four! Come on, comrades,',
    'put a bit of life into it! ONE, two, three',
    'four! ONE two, three, four!\' The pain',
    'of the coughing fit had not quite driven',
    'out of Winston\'s mind the impression made',
    'by his dream, and the rhythmic movements',
    'of the exercise restored it somewhat. As',
    'he mechanically shot his arms back and forth,',
    'wearing on his face the look of grim enjoyment',
    'which was considered proper during the Physical',
    'Jerks, he was struggling to think his way',
    'backward into the dim period of his early',
    'childhood. It was extraordinarily difficult.',
    'Beyond the late fifties everything faded.',
    'When there were no external records that',
    'you could refer to, even the outline of your',
    'own life lost its sharpness. You remembered',
    'huge events which had quite probably not',
    'happened, you remembered the detail of incidents',
    'without being able to recapture their atmosphere,',
    'and there were long blank periods to which',
    'you could assign nothing. Everything had',
    'been different then. Even the names of countries,',
    'and their shapes on the map, had been different.',
    'Airstrip One, for instance, had not been',
    'so called in those days: it had been called',
    'England or Britain, though London, he felt',
    'fairly certain, had always been called London.',
    'Winston could not definitely remember a time',
    'when his country had not been at war, but',
    'it was evident that there had been a fairly',
    'long interval of peace during his childhood,',
    'because one of his early memories was of',
    'an air raid which appeared to take everyone',
    'by surprise. Perhaps it was the time when',
    'the atomic bomb had fallen on Colchester.',
    'He did not remember the raid itself, but',
    'he did remember his father\'s hand clutching',
    'his own as they hurried down, down, down',
    'into some place deep in the earth, round',
    'and round a spiral staircase which rang under',
    'his feet and which finally so wearied his',
    'legs that he began whimpering and they had',
    'to stop and rest. His mother, in her slow,',
    'dreamy way, was following a long way behind',
    'them. She was carrying his baby sister, or',
    'perhaps it was only a bundle of blankets',
    'that she was carrying: he was not certain',
    'whether his sister had been born then. Finally',
    'they had emerged into a noisy, crowded place',
    'which he had realized to be a Tube station.',
    'There were people sitting all over the stone-flagged',
    'floor, and other people, packed tightly together,',
    'were sitting on metal bunks, one above the',
    'other. Winston and his mother and father',
    'found themselves a place on the floor, and',
    'near them an old man and an old woman were',
    'sitting side by side on a bunk. The old man',
    'had on a decent dark suit and a black cloth',
    'cap pushed back from very white hair: his',
    'face was scarlet and his eyes were blue and',
    'full of tears. He reeked of gin. It seemed',
    'to breathe out of his skin in place of sweat,',
    'and one could have fancied that the tears',
    'welling from his eyes were pure gin. But',
    'though slightly drunk he was also suffering',
    'under some grief that was genuine and unbearable.',
    'In his childish way Winston grasped that',
    'some terrible thing, something that was beyond',
    'forgiveness and could never be remedied,',
    'had just happened. It also seemed to him',
    'that he knew what it was. Someone whom the',
    'old man loved, a little granddaughter, perhaps,',
    'had been killed. Every few minutes the old',
    'man kept repeating: \'We didn\'t ought to \'ave',
    'trusted \'em. I said so, Ma, didn\'t I? That\'s',
    'what comes of trusting \'em. I said so all',
    'along. We didn\'t ought to \'ave trusted the',
    'buggers.\' But which buggers they didn\'t ought',
    'to have trusted Winston could not now remember.',
    'Since about that time, war had been literally',
    'continuous, though strictly speaking it had',
    'not always been the same war. For several',
    'months during his childhood there had been',
    'confused street fighting in London itself,',
    'some of which he remembered vividly. But',
    'to trace out the history of the whole period,',
    'to say who was fighting whom at any given',
    'moment, would have been utterly impossible,',
    'since no written record, and no spoken word,',
    'ever made mention of any other alignment',
    'than the existing one. At this moment, for',
    'example, in 1984 (if it was 1984), Oceania',
    'was at war with Eurasia and in alliance with',
    'Eastasia. In no public or private utterance',
    'was it ever admitted that the three powers',
    'had at any time been grouped along different',
    'lines. Actually, as Winston well knew, it',
    'was only four years since Oceania had been',
    'at war with Eastasia and in alliance with',
    'Eurasia. But that was merely a piece of furtive',
    'knowledge which he happened to possess because',
    'his memory was not satisfactorily under control.',
    'Officially the change of partners had never',
    'happened. Oceania was at war with Eurasia:',
    'therefore Oceania had always been at war',
    'with Eurasia. The enemy of the moment always',
    'represented absolute evil, and it followed',
    'that any past or future agreement with him',
    'was impossible. The frightening thing, he',
    'reflected for the ten thousandth time as',
    'he forced his shoulders painfully backward',
    '(with hands on hips, they were gyrating their',
    'bodies from the waist, an exercise that was',
    'supposed to be good for the back muscles),',
    'the frightening thing was that it might all',
    'be true. If the Party could thrust its hand',
    'into the past and say of this or that event,',
    'IT NEVER HAPPENED, that, surely, was more',
    'terrifying than mere torture and death? The',
    'Party said that Oceania had never been in',
    'alliance with Eurasia. He, Winston Smith,',
    'knew that Oceania had been in alliance with',
    'Eurasia as short a time as four years ago.',
    'But where did that knowledge exist? Only',
    'in his own consciousness, which in any case',
    'must soon be annihilated. And if all others',
    'accepted the lie which the Party imposed,',
    'if all records told the same tale, then the',
    'lie passed into history and became truth.',
    '\'Who controls the past,\' ran the Party slogan,',
    '\'controls the future: who controls the present',
    'controls the past.\' And yet the past, though',
    'of its nature alterable, never had been altered.',
    'Whatever was true now was true from everlasting',
    'to everlasting. It was quite simple. All',
    'that was needed was an unending series of',
    'victories over your own memory. \'Reality',
    'control\', they called it: in Newspeak, \'doublethink\'.',
    '\'Stand easy!\' barked the instructress, a',
    'little more genially. Winston sank his arms',
    'to his sides and slowly refilled his lungs',
    'with air. His mind slid away into the labyrinthine',
    'world of doublethink. To know and not to',
    'know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness',
    'while telling carefully constructed lies,',
    'to hold simultaneously two opinions which',
    'cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory',
    'and believing in both of them, to use logic',
    'against logic, to repudiate morality while',
    'laying claim to it, to believe that democracy',
    'was impossible and that the Party was the',
    'guardian of democracy, to forget whatever',
    'it was necessary to forget, then to draw',
    'it back into memory again at the moment when',
    'it was needed, and then promptly to forget',
    'it again: and above all, to apply the same',
    'process to the process itself. That was the',
    'ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce',
    'unconsciousness, and then, once again, to',
    'become unconscious of the act of hypnosis',
    'you had just performed. Even to understand',
    'the word \'doublethink\' involved the use of',
    'doublethink. The instructress had called',
    'them to attention again. \'And now let\'s see',
    'which of us can touch our toes!\' she said',
    'enthusiastically. \'Right over from the hips,',
    'please, comrades. ONE-two! ONE-two!\' Winston',
    'loathed this exercise, which sent shooting',
    'pains all the way from his heels to his buttocks',
    'and often ended by bringing on another coughing',
    'fit. The half-pleasant quality went out of',
    'his meditations. The past, he reflected,',
    'had not merely been altered, it had been',
    'actually destroyed. For how could you establish',
    'even the most obvious fact when there existed',
    'no record outside your own memory? He tried',
    'to remember in what year he had first heard',
    'mention of Big Brother. He thought it must',
    'have been at some time in the sixties, but',
    'it was impossible to be certain. In the Party',
    'histories, of course, Big Brother figured',
    'as the leader and guardian of the Revolution',
    'since its very earliest days. His exploits',
    'had been gradually pushed backwards in time',
    'until already they extended into the fabulous',
    'world of the forties and the thirties, when',
    'the capitalists in their strange cylindrical',
    'hats still rode through the streets of London',
    'in great gleaming motor-cars or horse carriages',
    'with glass sides. There was no knowing how',
    'much of this legend was true and how much',
    'invented. Winston could not even remember',
    'at what date the Party itself had come into',
    'existence. He did not believe he had ever',
    'heard the word Ingsoc before 1960, but it',
    'was possible that in its Oldspeak form, \'English',
    'Socialism\', that is to say, it had been current',
    'earlier. Everything melted into mist. Sometimes,',
    'indeed, you could put your finger on a definite',
    'lie. It was not true, for example, as was',
    'claimed in the Party history books, that',
    'the Party had invented aeroplanes. He remembered',
    'aeroplanes since his earliest childhood.',
    'But you could prove nothing. There was never',
    'any evidence. Just once in his whole life',
    'he had held in his hands unmistakable documentary',
    'proof of the falsification of an historical',
    'fact. And on that occasion, ,  \'Smith!\' screamed',
    'the shrewish voice from the telescreen. \'6079',
    'Smith W.! Yes, YOU! Bend lower, please! You',
    'can do better than that. You\'re not trying.',
    'Lower, please! THAT\'S better, comrade. Now',
    'stand at ease, the whole squad, and watch',
    'me.\' A sudden hot sweat had broken out all',
    'over Winston\'s body. His face remained completely',
    'inscrutable. Never show dismay! Never show',
    'resentment! A single flicker of the eyes',
    'could give you away. He stood watching while',
    'the instructress raised her arms above her',
    'head and, one could not say gracefully, but',
    'with remarkable neatness and efficiency,',
    'bent over and tucked the first joint of her',
    'fingers under her toes. \'THERE, comrades!',
    'THAT\'S how I want to see you doing it. Watch',
    'me again. I\'m thirty-nine and I\'ve had four',
    'children. Now look.\' She bent over again.',
    '\'You see MY knees aren\'t bent. You can all',
    'do it if you want to,\' she added as she straightened',
    'herself up. \'Anyone under forty-five is perfectly',
    'capable of touching his toes. We don\'t all',
    'have the privilege of fighting in the front',
    'line, but at least we can all keep fit. Remember',
    'our boys on the Malabar front! And the sailors',
    'in the Floating Fortresses! Just think what',
    'THEY have to put up with. Now try again.',
    'That\'s better, comrade, that\'s MUCH better,\'',
    'she added encouragingly as Winston, with',
    'a violent lunge, succeeded in touching his',
    'toes with knees unbent, for the first time',
    'in several years. Chapter 4 With the deep,',
    'unconscious sigh which not even the nearness',
    'of the telescreen could prevent him from',
    'uttering when his day\'s work started, Winston',
    'pulled the speakwrite towards him, blew the',
    'dust from its mouthpiece, and put on his',
    'spectacles. Then he unrolled and clipped',
    'together four small cylinders of paper which',
    'had already flopped out of the pneumatic',
    'tube on the right-hand side of his desk.',
    'In the walls of the cubicle there were three',
    'orifices. To the right of the speakwrite,',
    'a small pneumatic tube for written messages,',
    'to the left, a larger one for newspapers;',
    'and in the side wall, within easy reach of',
    'Winston\'s arm, a large oblong slit protected',
    'by a wire grating. This last was for the',
    'disposal of waste paper. Similar slits existed',
    'in thousands or tens of thousands throughout',
    'the building, not only in every room but',
    'at short intervals in every corridor. For',
    'some reason they were nicknamed memory holes.',
    'When one knew that any document was due for',
    'destruction, or even when one saw a scrap',
    'of waste paper lying about, it was an automatic',
    'action to lift the flap of the nearest memory',
    'hole and drop it in, whereupon it would be',
    'whirled away on a current of warm air to',
    'the enormous furnaces which were hidden somewhere',
    'in the recesses of the building. Winston',
    'examined the four slips of paper which he',
    'had unrolled. Each contained a message of',
    'only one or two lines, in the abbreviated',
    'jargon, not actually Newspeak, but consisting',
    'largely of Newspeak words, which was used',
    'in the Ministry for internal purposes. They',
    'ran: times 17.3.84 bb speech malreported',

    'bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons',
    'rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling With a',
    'faint feeling of satisfaction Winston laid',
    'the fourth message aside. It was an intricate',
    'and responsible job and had better be dealt',
    'with last. The other three were routine matters,',
    'though the second one would probably mean',
    'some tedious wading through lists of figures.',
    'Winston dialled \'back numbers\' on the telescreen',
    'and called for the appropriate issues of',
    '\'The Times\', which slid out of the pneumatic',
    'tube after only a few minutes\' delay. The',
    'messages he had received referred to articles',
    'or news items which for one reason or another',
    'it was thought necessary to alter, or, as',
    'the official phrase had it, to rectify. For',
    'example, it appeared from \'The Times\' of',
    'the seventeenth of March that Big Brother,',
    'in his speech of the previous day, had predicted',
    'that the South Indian front would remain',
    'quiet but that a Eurasian offensive would',
    'shortly be launched in North Africa. As it',
    'happened, the Eurasian Higher Command had',
    'launched its offensive in South India and',
    'left North Africa alone. It was therefore',
    'necessary to rewrite a paragraph of Big Brother\'s',
    'speech, in such a way as to make him predict',
    'the thing that had actually happened. Or',
    'again, \'The Times\' of the nineteenth of December',
    'had published the official forecasts of the',
    'output of various classes of consumption',
    'goods in the fourth quarter of 1983, which',
    'was also the sixth quarter of the Ninth Three-Year',
    'Plan. Today\'s issue contained a statement',
    'of the actual output, from which it appeared',
    'that the forecasts were in every instance',
    'grossly wrong. Winston\'s job was to rectify',
    'the original figures by making them agree',
    'with the later ones. As for the third message,',
    'it referred to a very simple error which',
    'could be set right in a couple of minutes.',
    'As short a time ago as February, the Ministry',
    'of Plenty had issued a promise (a \'categorical',
    'pledge\' were the official words) that there',
    'would be no reduction of the chocolate ration',
    'during 1984. Actually, as Winston was aware,',
    'the chocolate ration was to be reduced from',
    'thirty grammes to twenty at the end of the',
    'present week. All that was needed was to',
    'substitute for the original promise a warning',
    'that it would probably be necessary to reduce',
    'the ration at some time in April. As soon',
    'as Winston had dealt with each of the messages,',
    'he clipped his speakwritten corrections to',
    'the appropriate copy of \'The Times\' and pushed',
    'them into the pneumatic tube. Then, with',
    'a movement which was as nearly as possible',
    'unconscious, he crumpled up the original',
    'message and any notes that he himself had',
    'made, and dropped them into the memory hole',
    'to be devoured by the flames. What happened',
    'in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic',
    'tubes led, he did not know in detail, but',
    'he did know in general terms. As soon as',
    'all the corrections which happened to be',
    'necessary in any particular number of \'The',
    'Times\' had been assembled and collated, that',
    'number would be reprinted, the original copy',
    'destroyed, and the corrected copy placed',
    'on the files in its stead. This process of',
    'continuous alteration was applied not only',
    'to newspapers, but to books, periodicals,',
    'pamphlets, posters, leaflets, films, sound-tracks,',
    'cartoons, photographs, to every kind of literature',
    'or documentation which might conceivably',
    'hold any political or ideological significance.',
    'Day by day and almost minute by minute the',
    'past was brought up to date. In this way',
    'every prediction made by the Party could',
    'be shown by documentary evidence to have',
    'been correct, nor was any item of news, or',
    'any expression of opinion, which conflicted',
    'with the needs of the moment, ever allowed',
    'to remain on record. All history was a palimpsest,',
    'scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as',
    'often as was necessary. In no case would',
    'it have been possible, once the deed was',
    'done, to prove that any falsification had',
    'taken place. The largest section of the Records',
    'Department, far larger than the one on which',
    'Winston worked, consisted simply of persons',
    'whose duty it was to track down and collect',
    'all copies of books, newspapers, and other',
    'documents which had been superseded and were',
    'due for destruction. A number of \'The Times\'',
    'which might, because of changes in political',
    'alignment, or mistaken prophecies uttered',
    'by Big Brother, have been rewritten a dozen',
    'times still stood on the files bearing its',
    'original date, and no other copy existed',
    'to contradict it. Books, also, were recalled',
    'and rewritten again and again, and were invariably',
    'reissued without any admission that any alteration',
    'had been made. Even the written instructions',
    'which Winston received, and which he invariably',
    'got rid of as soon as he had dealt with them,',
    'never stated or implied that an act of forgery',
    'was to be committed: always the reference',
    'was to slips, errors, misprints, or misquotations',
    'which it was necessary to put right in the',
    'interests of accuracy. But actually, he thought',
    'as he re-adjusted the Ministry of Plenty\'s',
    'figures, it was not even forgery. It was',
    'merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense',
    'for another. Most of the material that you',
    'were dealing with had no connexion with anything',
    'in the real world, not even the kind of connexion',
    'that is contained in a direct lie. Statistics',
    'were just as much a fantasy in their original',
    'version as in their rectified version. A',
    'great deal of the time you were expected',
    'to make them up out of your head. For example,',
    'the Ministry of Plenty\'s forecast had estimated',
    'the output of boots for the quarter at 145',
    'million pairs. The actual output was given',
    'as sixty-two millions. Winston, however,',
    'in rewriting the forecast, marked the figure',
    'down to fifty-seven millions, so as to allow',
    'for the usual claim that the quota had been',
    'overfulfilled. In any case, sixty-two millions',
    'was no nearer the truth than fifty-seven',
    'millions, or than 145 millions. Very likely',
    'no boots had been produced at all. Likelier',
    'still, nobody knew how many had been produced,',
    'much less cared. All one knew was that every',
    'quarter astronomical numbers of boots were',
    'produced on paper, while perhaps half the',
    'population of Oceania went barefoot. And',
    'so it was with every class of recorded fact,',
    'great or small. Everything faded away into',
    'a shadow-world in which, finally, even the',
    'date of the year had become uncertain. Winston',
    'glanced across the hall. In the corresponding',
    'cubicle on the other side a small, precise-looking,',
    'dark-chinned man named Tillotson was working',
    'steadily away, with a folded newspaper on',
    'his knee and his mouth very close to the',
    'mouthpiece of the speakwrite. He had the',
    'air of trying to keep what he was saying',
    'a secret between himself and the telescreen.',
    'He looked up, and his spectacles darted a',
    'hostile flash in Winston\'s direction. Winston',
    'hardly knew Tillotson, and had no idea what',
    'work he was employed on. People in the Records',
    'Department did not readily talk about their',
    'jobs. In the long, windowless hall, with',
    'its double row of cubicles and its endless',
    'rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring',
    'into speakwrites, there were quite a dozen',
    'people whom Winston did not even know by',
    'name, though he daily saw them hurrying to',
    'and fro in the corridors or gesticulating',
    'in the Two Minutes Hate. He knew that in',
    'the cubicle next to him the little woman',
    'with sandy hair toiled day in day out, simply',
    'at tracking down and deleting from the Press',
    'the names of people who had been vaporized',
    'and were therefore considered never to have',
    'existed. There was a certain fitness in this,',
    'since her own husband had been vaporized',
    'a couple of years earlier. And a few cubicles',
    'away a mild, ineffectual, dreamy creature',
    'named Ampleforth, with very hairy ears and',
    'a surprising talent for juggling with rhymes',
    'and metres, was engaged in producing garbled',
    'versions, definitive texts, they were called,',
    'of poems which had become ideologically offensive,',
    'but which for one reason or another were',
    'to be retained in the anthologies. And this',
    'hall, with its fifty workers or thereabouts,',
    'was only one sub-section, a single cell,',
    'as it were, in the huge complexity of the',
    'Records Department. Beyond, above, below,',
    'were other swarms of workers engaged in an',
    'unimaginable multitude of jobs. There were',
    'the huge printing-shops with their sub-editors,',
    'their typography experts, and their elaborately',
    'equipped studios for the faking of photographs.',
    'There was the tele-programmes section with',
    'its engineers, its producers, and its teams',
    'of actors specially chosen for their skill',
    'in imitating voices. There were the armies',
    'of reference clerks whose job was simply',
    'to draw up lists of books and periodicals',
    'which were due for recall. There were the',
    'vast repositories where the corrected documents',
    'were stored, and the hidden furnaces where',
    'the original copies were destroyed. And somewhere',
    'or other, quite anonymous, there were the',
    'directing brains who co-ordinated the whole',
    'effort and laid down the lines of policy',
    'which made it necessary that this fragment',
    'of the past should be preserved, that one',
    'falsified, and the other rubbed out of existence.',
    'And the Records Department, after all, was',
    'itself only a single branch of the Ministry',
    'of Truth, whose primary job was not to reconstruct',
    'the past but to supply the citizens of Oceania',
    'with newspapers, films, textbooks, telescreen',
    'programmes, plays, novels, with every conceivable',
    'kind of information, instruction, or entertainment,',
    'from a statue to a slogan, from a lyric poem',
    'to a biological treatise, and from a child\'s',
    'spelling-book to a Newspeak dictionary. And',
    'the Ministry had not only to supply the multifarious',
    'needs of the party, but also to repeat the',
    'whole operation at a lower level for the',
    'benefit of the proletariat. There was a whole',
    'chain of separate departments dealing with',
    'proletarian literature, music, drama, and',
    'entertainment generally. Here were produced',
    'rubbishy newspapers containing almost nothing',
    'except sport, crime and astrology, sensational',
    'five-cent novelettes, films oozing with sex,',
    'and sentimental songs which were composed',
    'entirely by mechanical means on a special',
    'kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator.',
    'There was even a whole sub-section, Pornosec,',
    'it was called in Newspeak, engaged in producing',
    'the lowest kind of pornography, which was',
    'sent out in sealed packets and which no Party',
    'member, other than those who worked on it,',
    'was permitted to look at. Three messages',
    'had slid out of the pneumatic tube while',
    'Winston was working, but they were simple',
    'matters, and he had disposed of them before',
    'the Two Minutes Hate interrupted him. When',
    'the Hate was over he returned to his cubicle,',
    'took the Newspeak dictionary from the shelf,',
    'pushed the speakwrite to one side, cleaned',
    'his spectacles, and settled down to his main',
    'job of the morning. Winston\'s greatest pleasure',
    'in life was in his work. Most of it was a',
    'tedious routine, but included in it there',
    'were also jobs so difficult and intricate',
    'that you could lose yourself in them as in',
    'the depths of a mathematical problem, delicate',
    'pieces of forgery in which you had nothing',
    'to guide you except your knowledge of the',
    'principles of Ingsoc and your estimate of',
    'what the Party wanted you to say. Winston',
    'was good at this kind of thing. On occasion',
    'he had even been entrusted with the rectification',
    'of \'The Times\' leading articles, which were',
    'written entirely in Newspeak. He unrolled',
    'the message that he had set aside earlier.',
    'It ran: times 3.12.83 reporting bb dayorder',
    'doubleplusungood refs unpersons rewrite fullwise',
    'upsub antefiling In Oldspeak (or standard',
    'English) this might be rendered: The reporting',
    'of Big Brother\'s Order for the Day in \'The',
    'Times\' of December 3rd 1983 is extremely',
    'unsatisfactory and makes references to non-existent',
    'persons. Rewrite it in full and submit your',
    'draft to higher authority before filing.',
    'Winston read through the offending article.',
    'Big Brother\'s Order for the Day, it seemed,',
    'had been chiefly devoted to praising the',
    'work of an organization known as FFCC, which',
    'supplied cigarettes and other comforts to',
    'the sailors in the Floating Fortresses. A',
    'certain Comrade Withers, a prominent member',
    'of the Inner Party, had been singled out',
    'for special mention and awarded a decoration,',
    'the Order of Conspicuous Merit, Second Class.',
    'Three months later FFCC had suddenly been',
    'dissolved with no reasons given. One could',
    'assume that Withers and his associates were',
    'now in disgrace, but there had been no report',
    'of the matter in the Press or on the telescreen.',
    'That was to be expected, since it was unusual',
    'for political offenders to be put on trial',
    'or even publicly denounced. The great purges',
    'involving thousands of people, with public',
    'trials of traitors and thought-criminals',
    'who made abject confession of their crimes',
    'and were afterwards executed, were special',
    'show-pieces not occurring oftener than once',
    'in a couple of years. More commonly, people',
    'who had incurred the displeasure of the Party',
    'simply disappeared and were never heard of',
    'again. One never had the smallest clue as',
    'to what had happened to them. In some cases',
    'they might not even be dead. Perhaps thirty',
    'people personally known to Winston, not counting',
    'his parents, had disappeared at one time',
    'or another. Winston stroked his nose gently',
    'with a paper-clip. In the cubicle across',
    'the way Comrade Tillotson was still crouching',
    'secretively over his speakwrite. He raised',
    'his head for a moment: again the hostile',
    'spectacle-flash. Winston wondered whether',
    'Comrade Tillotson was engaged on the same',
    'job as himself. It was perfectly possible.',
    'So tricky a piece of work would never be',
    'entrusted to a single person: on the other',
    'hand, to turn it over to a committee would',
    'be to admit openly that an act of fabrication',
    'was taking place. Very likely as many as',
    'a dozen people were now working away on rival',
    'versions of what Big Brother had actually',
    'said. And presently some master brain in',
    'the Inner Party would select this version',
    'or that, would re-edit it and set in motion',
    'the complex processes of cross-referencing',
    'that would be required, and then the chosen',
    'lie would pass into the permanent records',
    'and become truth. Winston did not know why',
    'Withers had been disgraced. Perhaps it was',
    'for corruption or incompetence. Perhaps Big',
    'Brother was merely getting rid of a too-popular',
    'subordinate. Perhaps Withers or someone close',
    'to him had been suspected of heretical tendencies.',
    'Or perhaps, what was likeliest of all, the',
    'thing had simply happened because purges',
    'and vaporizations were a necessary part of',
    'the mechanics of government. The only real',
    'clue lay in the words \'refs unpersons\', which',
    'indicated that Withers was already dead.',
    'You could not invariably assume this to be',
    'the case when people were arrested. Sometimes',
    'they were released and allowed to remain',
    'at liberty for as much as a year or two years',
    'before being executed. Very occasionally',
    'some person whom you had believed dead long',
    'since would make a ghostly reappearance at',
    'some public trial where he would implicate',
    'hundreds of others by his testimony before',
    'vanishing, this time for ever. Withers, however,',
    'was already an UNPERSON. He did not exist:',
    'he had never existed. Winston decided that',
    'it would not be enough simply to reverse',
    'the tendency of Big Brother\'s speech. It',
    'was better to make it deal with something',
    'totally unconnected with its original subject.',
    'He might turn the speech into the usual denunciation',
    'of traitors and thought-criminals, but that',
    'was a little too obvious, while to invent',
    'a victory at the front, or some triumph of',
    'over-production in the Ninth Three-Year Plan,',
    'might complicate the records too much. What',
    'was needed was a piece of pure fantasy. Suddenly',
    'there sprang into his mind, ready made as',
    'it were, the image of a certain Comrade Ogilvy,',
    'who had recently died in battle, in heroic',
    'circumstances. There were occasions when',
    'Big Brother devoted his Order for the Day',
    'to commemorating some humble, rank-and-file',
    'Party member whose life and death he held',
    'up as an example worthy to be followed. Today',
    'he should commemorate Comrade Ogilvy. It',
    'was true that there was no such person as',
    'Comrade Ogilvy, but a few lines of print',
    'and a couple of faked photographs would soon',
    'bring him into existence. Winston thought',
    'for a moment, then pulled the speakwrite',
    'towards him and began dictating in Big Brother\'s',
    'familiar style: a style at once military',
    'and pedantic, and, because of a trick of',
    'asking questions and then promptly answering',
    'them (\'What lessons do we learn from this',
    'fact, comrades? The lesson, which is also',
    'one of the fundamental principles of Ingsoc,',
    'that,\' etc., etc.), easy to imitate. At the',
    'age of three Comrade Ogilvy had refused all',
    'toys except a drum, a sub-machine gun, and',
    'a model helicopter. At six, a year early,',
    'by a special relaxation of the rules, he',
    'had joined the Spies, at nine he had been',
    'a troop leader. At eleven he had denounced',
    'his uncle to the Thought Police after overhearing',
    'a conversation which appeared to him to have',
    'criminal tendencies. At seventeen he had',
    'been a district organizer of the Junior Anti-Sex',
    'League. At nineteen he had designed a hand-grenade',
    'which had been adopted by the Ministry of',
    'Peace and which, at its first trial, had',
    'killed thirty-one Eurasian prisoners in one',
    'burst. At twenty-three he had perished in',
    'action. Pursued by enemy jet planes while',
    'flying over the Indian Ocean with important',
    'despatches, he had weighted his body with',
    'his machine gun and leapt out of the helicopter',
    'into deep water, despatches and all, an end,',
    'said Big Brother, which it was impossible',
    'to contemplate without feelings of envy.',
    'Big Brother added a few remarks on the purity',
    'and single-mindedness of Comrade Ogilvy\'s',
    'life. He was a total abstainer and a nonsmoker,',
    'had no recreations except a daily hour in',
    'the gymnasium, and had taken a vow of celibacy,',
    'believing marriage and the care of a family',
    'to be incompatible with a twenty-four-hour-a-day',
    'devotion to duty. He had no subjects of conversation',
    'except the principles of Ingsoc, and no aim',
    'in life except the defeat of the Eurasian',
    'enemy and the hunting-down of spies, saboteurs,',
    'thought-criminals, and traitors generally.',
    'Winston debated with himself whether to award',
    'Comrade Ogilvy the Order of Conspicuous Merit:',
    'in the end he decided against it because',
    'of the unnecessary cross-referencing that',
    'it would entail. Once again he glanced at',
    'his rival in the opposite cubicle. Something',
    'seemed to tell him with certainty that Tillotson',
    'was busy on the same job as himself. There',
    'was no way of knowing whose job would finally',
    'be adopted, but he felt a profound conviction',
    'that it would be his own. Comrade Ogilvy,',
    'unimagined an hour ago, was now a fact. It',
    'struck him as curious that you could create',
    'dead men but not living ones. Comrade Ogilvy,',
    'who had never existed in the present, now',
    'existed in the past, and when once the act',
    'of forgery was forgotten, he would exist',
    'just as authentically, and upon the same',
    'evidence, as Charlemagne or Julius Caesar.',
    'Chapter 5 In the low-ceilinged canteen, deep',
    'underground, the lunch queue jerked slowly',
    'forward. The room was already very full and',
    'deafeningly noisy. From the grille at the',
    'counter the steam of stew came pouring forth,',
    'with a sour metallic smell which did not',
    'quite overcome the fumes of Victory Gin.',
    'On the far side of the room there was a small',
    'bar, a mere hole in the wall, where gin could',
    'be bought at ten cents the large nip. \'Just',
    'the man I was looking for,\' said a voice',
    'at Winston\'s back. He turned round. It was',
    'his friend Syme, who worked in the Research',
    'Department. Perhaps \'friend\' was not exactly',
    'the right word. You did not have friends',
    'nowadays, you had comrades: but there were',
    'some comrades whose society was pleasanter',
    'than that of others. Syme was a philologist,',
    'a specialist in Newspeak. Indeed, he was',
    'one of the enormous team of experts now engaged',
    'in compiling the Eleventh Edition of the',
    'Newspeak Dictionary. He was a tiny creature,',
    'smaller than Winston, with dark hair and',
    'large, protuberant eyes, at once mournful',
    'and derisive, which seemed to search your',
    'face closely while he was speaking to you.',
    '\'I wanted to ask you whether you\'d got any',
    'razor blades,\' he said. \'Not one!\' said Winston',
    'with a sort of guilty haste. \'I\'ve tried',
    'all over the place. They don\'t exist any',
    'longer.\' Everyone kept asking you for razor',
    'blades. Actually he had two unused ones which',
    'he was hoarding up. There had been a famine',
    'of them for months past. At any given moment',
    'there was some necessary article which the',
    'Party shops were unable to supply. Sometimes',
    'it was buttons, sometimes it was darning',
    'wool, sometimes it was shoelaces; at present',
    'it was razor blades. You could only get hold',
    'of them, if at all, by scrounging more or',
    'less furtively on the \'free\' market. \'I\'ve',
    'been using the same blade for six weeks,\'',
    'he added untruthfully. The queue gave another',
    'jerk forward. As they halted he turned and',
    'faced Syme again. Each of them took a greasy',
    'metal tray from a pile at the end of the',
    'counter. \'Did you go and see the prisoners',
    'hanged yesterday?\' said Syme. \'I was working,\'',
    'said Winston indifferently. \'I shall see',
    'it on the flicks, I suppose.\' \'A very inadequate',
    'substitute,\' said Syme. His mocking eyes',
    'roved over Winston\'s face. \'I know you,\'',
    'the eyes seemed to say, \'I see through you.',
    'I know very well why you didn\'t go to see',
    'those prisoners hanged.\' In an intellectual',
    'way, Syme was venomously orthodox. He would',
    'talk with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction',
    'of helicopter raids on enemy villages, and',
    'trials and confessions of thought-criminals,',
    'the executions in the cellars of the Ministry',
    'of Love. Talking to him was largely a matter',
    'of getting him away from such subjects and',
    'entangling him, if possible, in the technicalities',
    'of Newspeak, on which he was authoritative',
    'and interesting. Winston turned his head',
    'a little aside to avoid the scrutiny of the',
    'large dark eyes. \'It was a good hanging,\'',
    'said Syme reminiscently. \'I think it spoils',
    'it when they tie their feet together. I like',
    'to see them kicking. And above all, at the',
    'end, the tongue sticking right out, and blue,',
    'a quite bright blue. That\'s the detail that',
    'appeals to me.\' \'Nex\', please!\' yelled the',
    'white-aproned prole with the ladle. Winston',
    'and Syme pushed their trays beneath the grille.',
    'On to each was dumped swiftly the regulation',
    'lunch, a metal pannikin of pinkish-grey stew,',
    'a hunk of bread, a cube of cheese, a mug',
    'of milkless Victory Coffee, and one saccharine',
    'tablet. \'There\'s a table over there, under',
    'that telescreen,\' said Syme. \'Let\'s pick',
    'up a gin on the way.\' The gin was served',
    'out to them in handleless china mugs. They',
    'threaded their way across the crowded room',
    'and unpacked their trays on to the metal-topped',
    'table, on one corner of which someone had',
    'left a pool of stew, a filthy liquid mess',
    'that had the appearance of vomit. Winston',
    'took up his mug of gin, paused for an instant',
    'to collect his nerve, and gulped the oily-tasting',
    'stuff down. When he had winked the tears',
    'out of his eyes he suddenly discovered that',
    'he was hungry. He began swallowing spoonfuls',
    'of the stew, which, in among its general',
    'sloppiness, had cubes of spongy pinkish stuff',
    'which was probably a preparation of meat.',
    'Neither of them spoke again till they had',
    'emptied their pannikins. From the table at',
    'Winston\'s left, a little behind his back,',
    'someone was talking rapidly and continuously,',
    'a harsh gabble almost like the quacking of',
    'a duck, which pierced the general uproar',
    'of the room. \'How is the Dictionary getting',
    'on?\' said Winston, raising his voice to overcome',
    'the noise. \'Slowly,\' said Syme. \'I\'m on the',
    'adjectives. It\'s fascinating.\' He had brightened',
    'up immediately at the mention of Newspeak.',
    'He pushed his pannikin aside, took up his',
    'hunk of bread in one delicate hand and his',
    'cheese in the other, and leaned across the',
    'table so as to be able to speak without shouting.',
    '\'The Eleventh Edition is the definitive edition,\'',
    'he said. \'We\'re getting the language into',
    'its final shape, the shape it\'s going to',
    'have when nobody speaks anything else. When',
    'we\'ve finished with it, people like you will',
    'have to learn it all over again. You think,',
    'I dare say, that our chief job is inventing',
    'new words. But not a bit of it! We\'re destroying',
    'words, scores of them, hundreds of them,',
    'every day. We\'re cutting the language down',
    'to the bone. The Eleventh Edition won\'t contain',
    'a single word that will become obsolete before',
    'the year 2050.\' He bit hungrily into his',
    'bread and swallowed a couple of mouthfuls,',
    'then continued speaking, with a sort of pedant\'s',
    'passion. His thin dark face had become animated,',
    'his eyes had lost their mocking expression',
    'and grown almost dreamy. \'It\'s a beautiful',
    'thing, the destruction of words. Of course',
    'the great wastage is in the verbs and adjectives,',
    'but there are hundreds of nouns that can',
    'be got rid of as well. It isn\'t only the',
    'synonyms; there are also the antonyms. After',
    'all, what justification is there for a word',
    'which is simply the opposite of some other',
    'word? A word contains its opposite in itself.',
    'Take "good", for instance. If you have a',
    'word like "good", what need is there for',
    'a word like "bad"? "Ungood" will do just',
    'as well, better, because it\'s an exact opposite,',
    'which the other is not. Or again, if you',
    'want a stronger version of "good", what sense',
    'is there in having a whole string of vague',
    'useless words like "excellent" and "splendid"',
    'and all the rest of them? "Plusgood" covers',
    'the meaning, or "doubleplusgood" if you want',
    'something stronger still. Of course we use',
    'those forms already. but in the final version',
    'of Newspeak there\'ll be nothing else. In',
    'the end the whole notion of goodness and',
    'badness will be covered by only six words,',
    'in reality, only one word. Don\'t you see',
    'the beauty of that, Winston? It was B.B.\'s',
    'idea originally, of course,\' he added as',
    'an afterthought. A sort of vapid eagerness',
    'flitted across Winston\'s face at the mention',
    'of Big Brother. Nevertheless Syme immediately',
    'detected a certain lack of enthusiasm. \'You',
    'haven\'t a real appreciation of Newspeak,',
    'Winston,\' he said almost sadly. \'Even when',
    'you write it you\'re still thinking in Oldspeak.',
    'I\'ve read some of those pieces that you write',
    'in "The Times" occasionally. They\'re good',
    'enough, but they\'re translations. In your',
    'heart you\'d prefer to stick to Oldspeak,',
    'with all its vagueness and its useless shades',
    'of meaning. You don\'t grasp the beauty of',
    'the destruction of words. Do you know that',
    'Newspeak is the only language in the world',
    'whose vocabulary gets smaller every year?\'',
    'Winston did know that, of course. He smiled,',
    'sympathetically he hoped, not trusting himself',
    'to speak. Syme bit off another fragment of',
    'the dark-coloured bread, chewed it briefly,',
    'and went on: \'Don\'t you see that the whole',
    'aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of',
    'thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime',
    'literally impossible, because there will',
    'be no words in which to express it. Every',
    'concept that can ever be needed, will be',
    'expressed by exactly one word, with its meaning',
    'rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings',
    'rubbed out and forgotten. Already, in the',
    'Eleventh Edition, we\'re not far from that',
    'point. But the process will still be continuing',
    'long after you and I are dead. Every year',
    'fewer and fewer words, and the range of consciousness',
    'always a little smaller. Even now, of course,',
    'there\'s no reason or excuse for committing',
    'thoughtcrime. It\'s merely a question of self-discipline,',
    'reality-control. But in the end there won\'t',
    'be any need even for that. The Revolution',
    'will be complete when the language is perfect.',
    'Newspeak is Ingsoc and Ingsoc is Newspeak,\'',
    'he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction.',
    '\'Has it ever occurred to you, Winston, that',
    'by the year 2050, at the very latest, not',
    'a single human being will be alive who could',
    'understand such a conversation as we are',
    'having now?\' \'Except, , \' began Winston doubtfully,',
    'and he stopped. It had been on the tip of',
    'his tongue to say \'Except the proles,\' but',
    'he checked himself, not feeling fully certain',
    'that this remark was not in some way unorthodox.',
    'Syme, however, had divined what he was about',
    'to say. \'The proles are not human beings,\'',
    'he said carelessly. \'By 2050, earlier, probably,',
    'all real knowledge of Oldspeak will have',
    'disappeared. The whole literature of the',
    'past will have been destroyed. Chaucer, Shakespeare,',
    'Milton, Byron, they\'ll exist only in Newspeak',
    'versions, not merely changed into something',
    'different, but actually changed into something',
    'contradictory of what they used to be. Even',
    'the literature of the Party will change.',
    'Even the slogans will change. How could you',
    'have a slogan like "freedom is slavery" when',
    'the concept of freedom has been abolished?',
    'The whole climate of thought will be different.',
    'In fact there will be no thought, as we understand',
    'it now. Orthodoxy means not thinking, not',
    'needing to think. Orthodoxy is unconsciousness.\'',
    'One of these days, thought Winston with sudden',
    'deep conviction, Syme will be vaporized.',
    'He is too intelligent. He sees too clearly',
    'and speaks too plainly. The Party does not',
    'like such people. One day he will disappear.',
    'It is written in his face. Winston had finished',
    'his bread and cheese. He turned a little',
    'sideways in his chair to drink his mug of',
    'coffee. At the table on his left the man',
    'with the strident voice was still talking',
    'remorselessly away. A young woman who was',
    'perhaps his secretary, and who was sitting',
    'with her back to Winston, was listening to',
    'him and seemed to be eagerly agreeing with',
    'everything that he said. From time to time',
    'Winston caught some such remark as \'I think',
    'you\'re so right, I do so agree with you\',',
    'uttered in a youthful and rather silly feminine',
    'voice. But the other voice never stopped',
    'for an instant, even when the girl was speaking.',
    'Winston knew the man by sight, though he',
    'knew no more about him than that he held',
    'some important post in the Fiction Department.',
    'He was a man of about thirty, with a muscular',
    'throat and a large, mobile mouth. His head',
    'was thrown back a little, and because of',
    'the angle at which he was sitting, his spectacles',
    'caught the light and presented to Winston',
    'two blank discs instead of eyes. What was',
    'slightly horrible, was that from the stream',
    'of sound that poured out of his mouth it',
    'was almost impossible to distinguish a single',
    'word. Just once Winston caught a phrase,',
    '\'complete and final elimination of Goldsteinism\',',
    'jerked out very rapidly and, as it seemed,',
    'all in one piece, like a line of type cast',
    'solid. For the rest it was just a noise,',
    'a quack-quack-quacking. And yet, though you',
    'could not actually hear what the man was',
    'saying, you could not be in any doubt about',
    'its general nature. He might be denouncing',
    'Goldstein and demanding sterner measures',
    'against thought-criminals and saboteurs,',
    'he might be fulminating against the atrocities',
    'of the Eurasian army, he might be praising',
    'Big Brother or the heroes on the Malabar',
    'front, it made no difference. Whatever it',
    'was, you could be certain that every word',
    'of it was pure orthodoxy, pure Ingsoc. As',
    'he watched the eyeless face with the jaw',
    'moving rapidly up and down, Winston had a',
    'curious feeling that this was not a real',
    'human being but some kind of dummy. It was',
    'not the man\'s brain that was speaking, it',
    'was his larynx. The stuff that was coming',
    'out of him consisted of words, but it was',
    'not speech in the true sense: it was a noise',
    'uttered in unconsciousness, like the quacking',
    'of a duck. Syme had fallen silent for a moment,',
    'and with the handle of his spoon was tracing',
    'patterns in the puddle of stew. The voice',
    'from the other table quacked rapidly on,',
    'easily audible in spite of the surrounding',
    'din. \'There is a word in Newspeak,\' said',
    'Syme, \'I don\'t know whether you know it:',
    'DUCKSPEAK, to quack like a duck. It is one',
    'of those interesting words that have two',
    'contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent,',
    'it is abuse, applied to someone you agree',
    'with, it is praise.\' Unquestionably Syme',
    'will be vaporized, Winston thought again.',
    'He thought it with a kind of sadness, although',
    'well knowing that Syme despised him and slightly',
    'disliked him, and was fully capable of denouncing',
    'him as a thought-criminal if he saw any reason',
    'for doing so. There was something subtly',
    'wrong with Syme. There was something that',
    'he lacked: discretion, aloofness, a sort',
    'of saving stupidity. You could not say that',
    'he was unorthodox. He believed in the principles',
    'of Ingsoc, he venerated Big Brother, he rejoiced',
    'over victories, he hated heretics, not merely',
    'with sincerity but with a sort of restless',
    'zeal, an up-to-dateness of information, which',
    'the ordinary Party member did not approach.',
    'Yet a faint air of disreputability always',
    'clung to him. He said things that would have',
    'been better unsaid, he had read too many',
    'books, he frequented the Chestnut Tree Cafe,',
    'haunt of painters and musicians. There was',
    'no law, not even an unwritten law, against',
    'frequenting the Chestnut Tree Cafe, yet the',
    'place was somehow ill-omened. The old, discredited',
    'leaders of the Party had been used to gather',
    'there before they were finally purged. Goldstein',
    'himself, it was said, had sometimes been',
    'seen there, years and decades ago. Syme\'s',
    'fate was not difficult to foresee. And yet',
    'it was a fact that if Syme grasped, even',
    'for three seconds, the nature of his, Winston\'s,',
    'secret opinions, he would betray him instantly',
    'to the Thought Police. So would anybody else,',
    'for that matter: but Syme more than most.',
    'Zeal was not enough. Orthodoxy was unconsciousness.',
    'Syme looked up. \'Here comes Parsons,\' he',
    'said. Something in the tone of his voice',
    'seemed to add, \'that bloody fool\'. Parsons,',
    'Winston\'s fellow-tenant at Victory Mansions,',
    'was in fact threading his way across the',
    'room, a tubby, middle-sized man with fair',
    'hair and a froglike face. At thirty-five',
    'he was already putting on rolls of fat at',
    'neck and waistline, but his movements were',
    'brisk and boyish. His whole appearance was',
    'that of a little boy grown large, so much',
    'so that although he was wearing the regulation',
    'overalls, it was almost impossible not to',
    'think of him as being dressed in the blue',
    'shorts, grey shirt, and red neckerchief of',
    'the Spies. In visualizing him one saw always',
    'a picture of dimpled knees and sleeves rolled',
    'back from pudgy forearms. Parsons did, indeed,',
    'invariably revert to shorts when a community',
    'hike or any other physical activity gave',
    'him an excuse for doing so. He greeted them',
    'both with a cheery \'Hullo, hullo!\' and sat',
    'down at the table, giving off an intense',
    'smell of sweat. Beads of moisture stood out',
    'all over his pink face. His powers of sweating',
    'were extraordinary. At the Community Centre',
    'you could always tell when he had been playing',
    'table-tennis by the dampness of the bat handle.',
    'Syme had produced a strip of paper on which',
    'there was a long column of words, and was',
    'studying it with an ink-pencil between his',
    'fingers. \'Look at him working away in the',
    'lunch hour,\' said Parsons, nudging Winston.',
    '\'Keenness, eh? What\'s that you\'ve got there,',
    'old boy? Something a bit too brainy for me,',
    'I expect. Smith, old boy, I\'ll tell you why',
    'I\'m chasing you. It\'s that sub you forgot',
    'to give me.\' \'Which sub is that?\' said Winston,',
    'automatically feeling for money. About a',
    'quarter of one\'s salary had to be earmarked',
    'for voluntary subscriptions, which were so',
    'numerous that it was difficult to keep track',
    'of them. \'For Hate Week. You know, the house-by-house',
    'fund. I\'m treasurer for our block. We\'re',
    'making an all-out effort, going to put on',
    'a tremendous show. I tell you, it won\'t be',
    'my fault if old Victory Mansions doesn\'t',
    'have the biggest outfit of flags in the whole',
    'street. Two dollars you promised me.\' Winston',
    'found and handed over two creased and filthy',
    'notes, which Parsons entered in a small notebook,',
    'in the neat handwriting of the illiterate.',
    '\'By the way, old boy,\' he said. \'I hear that',
    'little beggar of mine let fly at you with',
    'his catapult yesterday. I gave him a good',
    'dressing-down for it. In fact I told him',
    'I\'d take the catapult away if he does it',
    'again.\' \'I think he was a little upset at',
    'not going to the execution,\' said Winston.',
    '\'Ah, well, what I mean to say, shows the',
    'right spirit, doesn\'t it? Mischievous little',
    'beggars they are, both of them, but talk',
    'about keenness! All they think about is the',
    'Spies, and the war, of course. D\'you know',
    'what that little girl of mine did last Saturday,',
    'when her troop was on a hike out Berkhamsted',
    'way? She got two other girls to go with her,',
    'slipped off from the hike, and spent the',
    'whole afternoon following a strange man.',
    'They kept on his tail for two hours, right',
    'through the woods, and then, when they got',
    'into Amersham, handed him over to the patrols.\'',
    '\'What did they do that for?\' said Winston,',
    'somewhat taken aback. Parsons went on triumphantly:',
    '\'My kid made sure he was some kind of enemy',
    'agent, might have been dropped by parachute,',
    'for instance. But here\'s the point, old boy.',
    'What do you think put her on to him in the',
    'first place? She spotted he was wearing a',
    'funny kind of shoes, said she\'d never seen',
    'anyone wearing shoes like that before. So',
    'the chances were he was a foreigner. Pretty',
    'smart for a nipper of seven, eh?\' \'What happened',
    'to the man?\' said Winston. \'Ah, that I couldn\'t',
    'say, of course. But I wouldn\'t be altogether',
    'surprised if, , \' Parsons made the motion',
    'of aiming a rifle, and clicked his tongue',
    'for the explosion. \'Good,\' said Syme abstractedly,',
    'without looking up from his strip of paper.',
    '\'Of course we can\'t afford to take chances,\'',
    'agreed Winston dutifully. \'What I mean to',
    'say, there is a war on,\' said Parsons. As',
    'though in confirmation of this, a trumpet',
    'call floated from the telescreen just above',
    'their heads. However, it was not the proclamation',
    'of a military victory this time, but merely',
    'an announcement from the Ministry of Plenty.',
    '\'Comrades!\' cried an eager youthful voice.',
    '\'Attention, comrades! We have glorious news',
    'for you. We have won the battle for production!',
    'Returns now completed of the output of all',
    'classes of consumption goods show that the',
    'standard of living has risen by no less than',
    '20 per cent over the past year. All over',
    'Oceania this morning there were irrepressible',
    'spontaneous demonstrations when workers marched',
    'out of factories and offices and paraded',
    'through the streets with banners voicing',
    'their gratitude to Big Brother for the new,',
    'happy life which his wise leadership has',
    'bestowed upon us. Here are some of the completed',
    'figures. Foodstuffs, , \' The phrase \'our',
    'new, happy life\' recurred several times.',
    'It had been a favourite of late with the',
    'Ministry of Plenty. Parsons, his attention',
    'caught by the trumpet call, sat listening',
    'with a sort of gaping solemnity, a sort of',
    'edified boredom. He could not follow the',
    'figures, but he was aware that they were',
    'in some way a cause for satisfaction. He',
    'had lugged out a huge and filthy pipe which',
    'was already half full of charred tobacco.',
    'With the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a',
    'week it was seldom possible to fill a pipe',
    'to the top. Winston was smoking a Victory',
    'Cigarette which he held carefully horizontal.',
    'The new ration did not start till tomorrow',
    'and he had only four cigarettes left. For',
    'the moment he had shut his ears to the remoter',
    'noises and was listening to the stuff that',
    'streamed out of the telescreen. It appeared',
    'that there had even been demonstrations to',
    'thank Big Brother for raising the chocolate',
    'ration to twenty grammes a week. And only',
    'yesterday, he reflected, it had been announced',
    'that the ration was to be REDUCED to twenty',
    'grammes a week. Was it possible that they',
    'could swallow that, after only twenty-four',
    'hours? Yes, they swallowed it. Parsons swallowed',
    'it easily, with the stupidity of an animal.',
    'The eyeless creature at the other table swallowed',
    'it fanatically, passionately, with a furious',
    'desire to track down, denounce, and vaporize',
    'anyone who should suggest that last week',
    'the ration had been thirty grammes. Syme,',
    'too, in some more complex way, involving',
    'doublethink, Syme swallowed it. Was he, then,',
    'ALONE in the possession of a memory? The',
    'fabulous statistics continued to pour out',
    'of the telescreen. As compared with last',
    'year there was more food, more clothes, more',
    'houses, more furniture, more cooking-pots,',
    'more fuel, more ships, more helicopters,',
    'more books, more babies, more of everything',
    'except disease, crime, and insanity. Year',
    'by year and minute by minute, everybody and',
    'everything was whizzing rapidly upwards.',
    'As Syme had done earlier Winston had taken',
    'up his spoon and was dabbling in the pale-coloured',
    'gravy that dribbled across the table, drawing',
    'a long streak of it out into a pattern. He',
    'meditated resentfully on the physical texture',
    'of life. Had it always been like this? Had',
    'food always tasted like this? He looked round',
    'the canteen. A low-ceilinged, crowded room,',
    'its walls grimy from the contact of innumerable',
    'bodies; battered metal tables and chairs,',
    'placed so close together that you sat with',
    'elbows touching; bent spoons, dented trays,',
    'coarse white mugs; all surfaces greasy, grime',
    'in every crack; and a sourish, composite',
    'smell of bad gin and bad coffee and metallic',
    'stew and dirty clothes. Always in your stomach',
    'and in your skin there was a sort of protest,',
    'a feeling that you had been cheated of something',
    'that you had a right to. It was true that',
    'he had no memories of anything greatly different.',
    'In any time that he could accurately remember,',
    'there had never been quite enough to eat,',
    'one had never had socks or underclothes that',
    'were not full of holes, furniture had always',
    'been battered and rickety, rooms underheated,',
    'tube trains crowded, houses falling to pieces,',
    'bread dark-coloured, tea a rarity, coffee',
    'filthy-tasting, cigarettes insufficient,',
    'nothing cheap and plentiful except synthetic',
    'gin. And though, of course, it grew worse',
    'as one\'s body aged, was it not a sign that',
    'this was NOT the natural order of things,',
    'if one\'s heart sickened at the discomfort',
    'and dirt and scarcity, the interminable winters,',
    'the stickiness of one\'s socks, the lifts',
    'that never worked, the cold water, the gritty',
    'soap, the cigarettes that came to pieces,',
    'the food with its strange evil tastes? Why',
    'should one feel it to be intolerable unless',
    'one had some kind of ancestral memory that',
    'things had once been different? He looked',
    'round the canteen again. Nearly everyone',
    'was ugly, and would still have been ugly',
    'even if dressed otherwise than in the uniform',
    'blue overalls. On the far side of the room,',
    'sitting at a table alone, a small, curiously',
    'beetle-like man was drinking a cup of coffee,',
    'his little eyes darting suspicious glances',
    'from side to side. How easy it was, thought',
    'Winston, if you did not look about you, to',
    'believe that the physical type set up by',
    'the Party as an ideal, tall muscular youths',
    'and deep-bosomed maidens, blond-haired, vital,',
    'sunburnt, carefree, existed and even predominated.',
    'Actually, so far as he could judge, the majority',
    'of people in Airstrip One were small, dark,',
    'and ill-favoured. It was curious how that',
    'beetle-like type proliferated in the Ministries:',
    'little dumpy men, growing stout very early',
    'in life, with short legs, swift scuttling',
    'movements, and fat inscrutable faces with',
    'very small eyes. It was the type that seemed',
    'to flourish best under the dominion of the',
    'Party. The announcement from the Ministry',
    'of Plenty ended on another trumpet call and',
    'gave way to tinny music. Parsons, stirred',
    'to vague enthusiasm by the bombardment of',
    'figures, took his pipe out of his mouth.',
    '\'The Ministry of Plenty\'s certainly done',
    'a good job this year,\' he said with a knowing',
    'shake of his head. \'By the way, Smith old',
    'boy, I suppose you haven\'t got any razor',
    'blades you can let me have?\' \'Not one,\' said',
    'Winston. \'I\'ve been using the same blade',
    'for six weeks myself.\' \'Ah, well, just thought',
    'I\'d ask you, old boy.\' \'Sorry,\' said Winston.',
    'The quacking voice from the next table, temporarily',
    'silenced during the Ministry\'s announcement,',
    'had started up again, as loud as ever. For',
    'some reason Winston suddenly found himself',
    'thinking of Mrs Parsons, with her wispy hair',
    'and the dust in the creases of her face.',
    'Within two years those children would be',
    'denouncing her to the Thought Police. Mrs',
    'Parsons would be vaporized. Syme would be',
    'vaporized. Winston would be vaporized. O\'Brien',
    'would be vaporized. Parsons, on the other',
    'hand, would never be vaporized. The eyeless',
    'creature with the quacking voice would never',
    'be vaporized. The little beetle-like men',
    'who scuttle so nimbly through the labyrinthine',
    'corridors of Ministries they, too, would',
    'never be vaporized. And the girl with dark',
    'hair, the girl from the Fiction Department,',
    'she would never be vaporized either. It seemed',
    'to him that he knew instinctively who would',
    'survive and who would perish: though just',
    'what it was that made for survival, it was',
    'not easy to say. At this moment he was dragged',
    'out of his reverie with a violent jerk. The',
    'girl at the next table had turned partly',
    'round and was looking at him. It was the',
    'girl with dark hair. She was looking at him',
    'in a sidelong way, but with curious intensity.',
    'The instant she caught his eye she looked',
    'away again. The sweat started out on Winston\'s',
    'backbone. A horrible pang of terror went',
    'through him. It was gone almost at once,',
    'but it left a sort of nagging uneasiness',
    'behind. Why was she watching him? Why did',
    'she keep following him about? Unfortunately',
    'he could not remember whether she had already',
    'been at the table when he arrived, or had',
    'come there afterwards. But yesterday, at',
    'any rate, during the Two Minutes Hate, she',
    'had sat immediately behind him when there',
    'was no apparent need to do so. Quite likely',
    'her real object had been to listen to him',
    'and make sure whether he was shouting loudly',
    'enough. His earlier thought returned to him:',
    'probably she was not actually a member of',
    'the Thought Police, but then it was precisely',
    'the amateur spy who was the greatest danger',
    'of all. He did not know how long she had',
    'been looking at him, but perhaps for as much',
    'as five minutes, and it was possible that',
    'his features had not been perfectly under',
    'control. It was terribly dangerous to let',
    'your thoughts wander when you were in any',
    'public place or within range of a telescreen.',
    'The smallest thing could give you away. A',
    'nervous tic, an unconscious look of anxiety,',
    'a habit of muttering to yourself, anything',
    'that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality,',
    'of having something to hide. In any case,',
    'to wear an improper expression on your face',
    '(to look incredulous when a victory was announced,',
    'for example) was itself a punishable offence.',
    'There was even a word for it in Newspeak:',
    'FACECRIME, it was called. The girl had turned',
    'her back on him again. Perhaps after all',
    'she was not really following him about, perhaps',
    'it was coincidence that she had sat so close',
    'to him two days running. His cigarette had',
    'gone out, and he laid it carefully on the',
    'edge of the table. He would finish smoking',
    'it after work, if he could keep the tobacco',
    'in it. Quite likely the person at the next',
    'table was a spy of the Thought Police, and',
    'quite likely he would be in the cellars of',
    'the Ministry of Love within three days, but',
    'a cigarette end must not be wasted. Syme',
    'had folded up his strip of paper and stowed',
    'it away in his pocket. Parsons had begun',
    'talking again. \'Did I ever tell you, old',
    'boy,\' he said, chuckling round the stem of',
    'his pipe, \'about the time when those two',
    'nippers of mine set fire to the old market-woman\'s',
    'skirt because they saw her wrapping up sausages',
    'in a poster of B.B.? Sneaked up behind her',
    'and set fire to it with a box of matches.',
    'Burned her quite badly, I believe. Little',
    'beggars, eh? But keen as mustard! That\'s',
    'a first-rate training they give them in the',
    'Spies nowadays, better than in my day, even.',
    'What d\'you think\'s the latest thing they\'ve',
    'served them out with? Ear trumpets for listening',
    'through keyholes! My little girl brought',
    'one home the other night, tried it out on',
    'our sitting-room door, and reckoned she could',
    'hear twice as much as with her ear to the',
    'hole. Of course it\'s only a toy, mind you.',
    'Still, gives \'em the right idea, eh?\' At',
    'this moment the telescreen let out a piercing',
    'whistle. It was the signal to return to work.',
    'All three men sprang to their feet to join',
    'in the struggle round the lifts, and the',
    'remaining tobacco fell out of Winston\'s cigarette.',
    'Chapter 6 Winston was writing in his diary:',
    'It was three years ago. It was on a dark',
    'evening, in a narrow side-street near one',
    'of the big railway stations. She was standing',
    'near a doorway in the wall, under a street',
    'lamp that hardly gave any light. She had',
    'a young face, painted very thick. It was',
    'really the paint that appealed to me, the',
    'whiteness of it, like a mask, and the bright',
    'red lips. Party women never paint their faces.',
    'There was nobody else in the street, and',
    'no telescreens. She said two dollars. I,',
    ',  For the moment it was too difficult to',
    'go on. He shut his eyes and pressed his fingers',
    'against them, trying to squeeze out the vision',
    'that kept recurring. He had an almost overwhelming',
    'temptation to shout a string of filthy words',
    'at the top of his voice. Or to bang his head',
    'against the wall, to kick over the table,',
    'and hurl the inkpot through the window, to',
    'do any violent or noisy or painful thing',
    'that might black out the memory that was',
    'tormenting him. Your worst enemy, he reflected,',
    'was your own nervous system. At any moment',
    'the tension inside you was liable to translate',
    'itself into some visible symptom. He thought',
    'of a man whom he had passed in the street',
    'a few weeks back; a quite ordinary-looking',
    'man, a Party member, aged thirty-five to',
    'forty, tallish and thin, carrying a brief-case.',
    'They were a few metres apart when the left',
    'side of the man\'s face was suddenly contorted',
    'by a sort of spasm. It happened again just',
    'as they were passing one another: it was',
    'only a twitch, a quiver, rapid as the clicking',
    'of a camera shutter, but obviously habitual.',
    'He remembered thinking at the time: That',
    'poor devil is done for. And what was frightening',
    'was that the action was quite possibly unconscious.',
    'The most deadly danger of all was talking',
    'in your sleep. There was no way of guarding',
    'against that, so far as he could see. He',
    'drew his breath and went on writing: I went',
    'with her through the doorway and across a',
    'backyard into a basement kitchen. There was',
    'a bed against the wall, and a lamp on the',
    'table, turned down very low. She, ,  His',
    'teeth were set on edge. He would have liked',
    'to spit. Simultaneously with the woman in',
    'the basement kitchen he thought of Katharine,',
    'his wife. Winston was married, had been married,',
    'at any rate: probably he still was married,',
    'so far as he knew his wife was not dead.',
    'He seemed to breathe again the warm stuffy',
    'odour of the basement kitchen, an odour compounded',
    'of bugs and dirty clothes and villainous',
    'cheap scent, but nevertheless alluring, because',
    'no woman of the Party ever used scent, or',
    'could be imagined as doing so. Only the proles',
    'used scent. In his mind the smell of it was',
    'inextricably mixed up with fornication. When',
    'he had gone with that woman it had been his',
    'first lapse in two years or thereabouts.',
    'Consorting with prostitutes was forbidden,',
    'of course, but it was one of those rules',
    'that you could occasionally nerve yourself',
    'to break. It was dangerous, but it was not',
    'a life-and-death matter. To be caught with',
    'a prostitute might mean five years in a forced-labour',
    'camp: not more, if you had committed no other',
    'offence. And it was easy enough, provided',
    'that you could avoid being caught in the',
    'act. The poorer quarters swarmed with women',
    'who were ready to sell themselves. Some could',
    'even be purchased for a bottle of gin, which',
    'the proles were not supposed to drink. Tacitly',
    'the Party was even inclined to encourage',
    'prostitution, as an outlet for instincts',
    'which could not be altogether suppressed.',
    'Mere debauchery did not matter very much,',
    'so long as it was furtive and joyless and',
    'only involved the women of a submerged and',
    'despised class. The unforgivable crime was',
    'promiscuity between Party members. But, though',
    'this was one of the crimes that the accused',
    'in the great purges invariably confessed',
    'to, it was difficult to imagine any such',
    'thing actually happening. The aim of the',
    'Party was not merely to prevent men and women',
    'from forming loyalties which it might not',
    'be able to control. Its real, undeclared',
    'purpose was to remove all pleasure from the',
    'sexual act. Not love so much as eroticism',
    'was the enemy, inside marriage as well as',
    'outside it. All marriages between Party members',
    'had to be approved by a committee appointed',
    'for the purpose, and, though the principle',
    'was never clearly stated, permission was',
    'always refused if the couple concerned gave',
    'the impression of being physically attracted',
    'to one another. The only recognized purpose',
    'of marriage was to beget children for the',
    'service of the Party. Sexual intercourse',
    'was to be looked on as a slightly disgusting',
    'minor operation, like having an enema. This',
    'again was never put into plain words, but',
    'in an indirect way it was rubbed into every',
    'Party member from childhood onwards. There',
    'were even organizations such as the Junior',
    'Anti-Sex League, which advocated complete',
    'celibacy for both sexes. All children were',
    'to be begotten by artificial insemination',
    '(ARTSEM, it was called in Newspeak) and brought',
    'up in public institutions. This, Winston',
    'was aware, was not meant altogether seriously,',
    'but somehow it fitted in with the general',
    'ideology of the Party. The Party was trying',
    'to kill the sex instinct, or, if it could',
    'not be killed, then to distort it and dirty',
    'it. He did not know why this was so, but',
    'it seemed natural that it should be so. And',
    'as far as the women were concerned, the Party\'s',
    'efforts were largely successful. He thought',
    'again of Katharine. It must be nine, ten,',
    'nearly eleven years since they had parted.',
    'It was curious how seldom he thought of her.',
    'For days at a time he was capable of forgetting',
    'that he had ever been married. They had only',
    'been together for about fifteen months. The',
    'Party did not permit divorce, but it rather',
    'encouraged separation in cases where there',
    'were no children. Katharine was a tall, fair-haired',
    'girl, very straight, with splendid movements.',
    'She had a bold, aquiline face, a face that',
    'one might have called noble until one discovered',
    'that there was as nearly as possible nothing',
    'behind it. Very early in her married life',
    'he had decided, though perhaps it was only',
    'that he knew her more intimately than he',
    'knew most people, that she had without exception',
    'the most stupid, vulgar, empty mind that',
    'he had ever encountered. She had not a thought',
    'in her head that was not a slogan, and there',
    'was no imbecility, absolutely none that she',
    'was not capable of swallowing if the Party',
    'handed it out to her. \'The human sound-track\'',
    'he nicknamed her in his own mind. Yet he',
    'could have endured living with her if it',
    'had not been for just one thing, sex. As',
    'soon as he touched her she seemed to wince',
    'and stiffen. To embrace her was like embracing',
    'a jointed wooden image. And what was strange',
    'was that even when she was clasping him against',
    'her he had the feeling that she was simultaneously',
    'pushing him away with all her strength. The',
    'rigidity of her muscles managed to convey',
    'that impression. She would lie there with',
    'shut eyes, neither resisting nor co-operating',
    'but SUBMITTING. It was extraordinarily embarrassing,',
    'and, after a while, horrible. But even then',
    'he could have borne living with her if it',
    'had been agreed that they should remain celibate.',
    'But curiously enough it was Katharine who',
    'refused this. They must, she said, produce',
    'a child if they could. So the performance',
    'continued to happen, once a week quite regularly,',
    'whenever it was not impossible. She even',
    'used to remind him of it in the morning,',
    'as something which had to be done that evening',
    'and which must not be forgotten. She had',
    'two names for it. One was \'making a baby\',',
    'and the other was \'our duty to the Party\'',
    '(yes, she had actually used that phrase).',
    'Quite soon he grew to have a feeling of positive',
    'dread when the appointed day came round.',
    'But luckily no child appeared, and in the',
    'end she agreed to give up trying, and soon',
    'afterwards they parted. Winston sighed inaudibly.',
    'He picked up his pen again and wrote: She',
    'threw herself down on the bed, and at once,',
    'without any kind of preliminary in the most',
    'coarse, horrible way you can imagine, pulled',
    'up her skirt. I, ,  He saw himself standing',
    'there in the dim lamplight, with the smell',
    'of bugs and cheap scent in his nostrils,',
    'and in his heart a feeling of defeat and',
    'resentment which even at that moment was',
    'mixed up with the thought of Katharine\'s',
    'white body, frozen for ever by the hypnotic',
    'power of the Party. Why did it always have',
    'to be like this? Why could he not have a',
    'woman of his own instead of these filthy',
    'scuffles at intervals of years? But a real',
    'love affair was an almost unthinkable event.',
    'The women of the Party were all alike. Chastity',
    'was as deep ingrained in them as Party loyalty.',
    'By careful early conditioning, by games and',
    'cold water, by the rubbish that was dinned',
    'into them at school and in the Spies and',
    'the Youth League, by lectures, parades, songs,',
    'slogans, and martial music, the natural feeling',
    'had been driven out of them. His reason told',
    'him that there must be exceptions, but his',
    'heart did not believe it. They were all impregnable,',
    'as the Party intended that they should be.',
    'And what he wanted, more even than to be',
    'loved, was to break down that wall of virtue,',
    'even if it were only once in his whole life.',
    'The sexual act, successfully performed, was',
    'rebellion. Desire was thoughtcrime. Even',
    'to have awakened Katharine, if he could have',
    'achieved it, would have been like a seduction,',
    'although she was his wife. But the rest of',
    'the story had got to be written down. He',
    'wrote: I turned up the lamp. When I saw her',
    'in the light, ,  After the darkness the feeble',
    'light of the paraffin lamp had seemed very',
    'bright. For the first time he could see the',
    'woman properly. He had taken a step towards',
    'her and then halted, full of lust and terror.',
    'He was painfully conscious of the risk he',
    'had taken in coming here. It was perfectly',
    'possible that the patrols would catch him',
    'on the way out: for that matter they might',
    'be waiting outside the door at this moment.',
    'If he went away without even doing what he',
    'had come here to do, , ! It had got to be',
    'written down, it had got to be confessed.',
    'What he had suddenly seen in the lamplight',
    'was that the woman was OLD. The paint was',
    'plastered so thick on her face that it looked',
    'as though it might crack like a cardboard',
    'mask. There were streaks of white in her',
    'hair; but the truly dreadful detail was that',
    'her mouth had fallen a little open, revealing',
    'nothing except a cavernous blackness. She',
    'had no teeth at all. He wrote hurriedly,',
    'in scrabbling handwriting: When I saw her',
    'in the light she was quite an old woman,',
    'fifty years old at least. But I went ahead',
    'and did it just the same. He pressed his',
    'fingers against his eyelids again. He had',
    'written it down at last, but it made no difference.',
    'The therapy had not worked. The urge to shout',
    'filthy words at the top of his voice was',
    'as strong as ever. Chapter 7 \'If there is',
    'hope,\' wrote Winston, \'it lies in the proles.\'',
    'If there was hope, it MUST lie in the proles,',
    'because only there in those swarming disregarded',
    'masses, 85 per cent of the population of',
    'Oceania, could the force to destroy the Party',
    'ever be generated. The Party could not be',
    'overthrown from within. Its enemies, if it',
    'had any enemies, had no way of coming together',
    'or even of identifying one another. Even',
    'if the legendary Brotherhood existed, as',
    'just possibly it might, it was inconceivable',
    'that its members could ever assemble in larger',
    'numbers than twos and threes. Rebellion meant',
    'a look in the eyes, an inflexion of the voice,',
    'at the most, an occasional whispered word.',
    'But the proles, if only they could somehow',
    'become conscious of their own strength. would',
    'have no need to conspire. They needed only',
    'to rise up and shake themselves like a horse',
    'shaking off flies. If they chose they could',
    'blow the Party to pieces tomorrow morning.',
    'Surely sooner or later it must occur to them',
    'to do it? And yet, , ! He remembered how',
    'once he had been walking down a crowded street',
    'when a tremendous shout of hundreds of voices',
    'women\'s voices, had burst from a side-street',
    'a little way ahead. It was a great formidable',
    'cry of anger and despair, a deep, loud \'Oh-o-o-o-oh!\'',
    'that went humming on like the reverberation',
    'of a bell. His heart had leapt. It\'s started!',
    'he had thought. A riot! The proles are breaking',
    'loose at last! When he had reached the spot',
    'it was to see a mob of two or three hundred',
    'women crowding round the stalls of a street',
    'market, with faces as tragic as though they',
    'had been the doomed passengers on a sinking',
    'ship. But at this moment the general despair',
    'broke down into a multitude of individual',
    'quarrels. It appeared that one of the stalls',
    'had been selling tin saucepans. They were',
    'wretched, flimsy things, but cooking-pots',
    'of any kind were always difficult to get.',
    'Now the supply had unexpectedly given out.',
    'The successful women, bumped and jostled',
    'by the rest, were trying to make off with',
    'their saucepans while dozens of others clamoured',
    'round the stall, accusing the stall-keeper',
    'of favouritism and of having more saucepans',
    'somewhere in reserve. There was a fresh outburst',
    'of yells. Two bloated women, one of them',
    'with her hair coming down, had got hold of',
    'the same saucepan and were trying to tear',
    'it out of one another\'s hands. For a moment',
    'they were both tugging, and then the handle',
    'came off. Winston watched them disgustedly.',
    'And yet, just for a moment, what almost frightening',
    'power had sounded in that cry from only a',
    'few hundred throats! Why was it that they',
    'could never shout like that about anything',
    'that mattered? He wrote: Until they become',
    'conscious they will never rebel, and until',
    'after they have rebelled they cannot become',
    'conscious. That, he reflected, might almost',
    'have been a transcription from one of the',
    'Party textbooks. The Party claimed, of course,',
    'to have liberated the proles from bondage.',
    'Before the Revolution they had been hideously',
    'oppressed by the capitalists, they had been',
    'starved and flogged, women had been forced',
    'to work in the coal mines (women still did',
    'work in the coal mines, as a matter of fact),',
    'children had been sold into the factories',
    'at the age of six. But simultaneously, true',
    'to the Principles of doublethink, the Party',
    'taught that the proles were natural inferiors',
    'who must be kept in subjection, like animals,',
    'by the application of a few simple rules.',
    'In reality very little was known about the',
    'proles. It was not necessary to know much.',
    'So long as they continued to work and breed,',
    'their other activities were without importance.',
    'Left to themselves, like cattle turned loose',
    'upon the plains of Argentina, they had reverted',
    'to a style of life that appeared to be natural',
    'to them, a sort of ancestral pattern. They',
    'were born, they grew up in the gutters, they',
    'went to work at twelve, they passed through',
    'a brief blossoming-period of beauty and sexual',
    'desire, they married at twenty, they were',
    'middle-aged at thirty, they died, for the',
    'most part, at sixty. Heavy physical work,',
    'the care of home and children, petty quarrels',
    'with neighbours, films, football, beer, and',
    'above all, gambling, filled up the horizon',
    'of their minds. To keep them in control was',
    'not difficult. A few agents of the Thought',
    'Police moved always among them, spreading',
    'false rumours and marking down and eliminating',
    'the few individuals who were judged capable',
    'of becoming dangerous; but no attempt was',
    'made to indoctrinate them with the ideology',
    'of the Party. It was not desirable that the',
    'proles should have strong political feelings.',
    'All that was required of them was a primitive',
    'patriotism which could be appealed to whenever',
    'it was necessary to make them accept longer',
    'working-hours or shorter rations. And even',
    'when they became discontented, as they sometimes',
    'did, their discontent led nowhere, because',
    'being without general ideas, they could only',
    'focus it on petty specific grievances. The',
    'larger evils invariably escaped their notice.',
    'The great majority of proles did not even',
    'have telescreens in their homes. Even the',
    'civil police interfered with them very little.',
    'There was a vast amount of criminality in',
    'London, a whole world-within-a-world of thieves,',
    'bandits, prostitutes, drug-peddlers, and',
    'racketeers of every description; but since',
    'it all happened among the proles themselves,',
    'it was of no importance. In all questions',
    'of morals they were allowed to follow their',
    'ancestral code. The sexual puritanism of',
    'the Party was not imposed upon them. Promiscuity',
    'went unpunished, divorce was permitted. For',
    'that matter, even religious worship would',
    'have been permitted if the proles had shown',
    'any sign of needing or wanting it. They were',
    'beneath suspicion. As the Party slogan put',
    'it: \'Proles and animals are free.\' Winston',
    'reached down and cautiously scratched his',
    'varicose ulcer. It had begun itching again.',
    'The thing you invariably came back to was',
    'the impossibility of knowing what life before',
    'the Revolution had really been like. He took',
    'out of the drawer a copy of a children\'s',
    'history textbook which he had borrowed from',
    'Mrs Parsons, and began copying a passage',
    'into the diary: In the old days (it ran),',
    'before the glorious Revolution, London was',
    'not the beautiful city that we know today.',
    'It was a dark, dirty, miserable place where',
    'hardly anybody had enough to eat and where',
    'hundreds and thousands of poor people had',
    'no boots on their feet and not even a roof',
    'to sleep under. Children no older than you',
    'had to work twelve hours a day for cruel',
    'masters who flogged them with whips if they',
    'worked too slowly and fed them on nothing',
    'but stale breadcrusts and water. But in among',
    'all this terrible poverty there were just',
    'a few great big beautiful houses that were',
    'lived in by rich men who had as many as thirty',
    'servants to look after them. These rich men',
    'were called capitalists. They were fat, ugly',
    'men with wicked faces, like the one in the',
    'picture on the opposite page. You can see',
    'that he is dressed in a long black coat which',
    'was called a frock coat, and a queer, shiny',
    'hat shaped like a stovepipe, which was called',
    'a top hat. This was the uniform of the capitalists,',
    'and no one else was allowed to wear it. The',
    'capitalists owned everything in the world,',
    'and everyone else was their slave. They owned',
    'all the land, all the houses, all the factories,',
    'and all the money. If anyone disobeyed them',
    'they could throw them into prison, or they',
    'could take his job away and starve him to',
    'death. When any ordinary person spoke to',
    'a capitalist he had to cringe and bow to',
    'him, and take off his cap and address him',
    'as \'Sir\'. The chief of all the capitalists',
    'was called the King, and, ,  But he knew',
    'the rest of the catalogue. There would be',
    'mention of the bishops in their lawn sleeves,',
    'the judges in their ermine robes, the pillory,',
    'the stocks, the treadmill, the cat-o\'-nine',
    'tails, the Lord Mayor\'s Banquet, and the',
    'practice of kissing the Pope\'s toe. There',
    'was also something called the JUS PRIMAE',
    'NOCTIS, which would probably not be mentioned',
    'in a textbook for children. It was the law',
    'by which every capitalist had the right to',
    'sleep with any woman working in one of his',
    'factories. How could you tell how much of',
    'it was lies? It MIGHT be true that the average',
    'human being was better off now than he had',
    'been before the Revolution. The only evidence',
    'to the contrary was the mute protest in your',
    'own bones, the instinctive feeling that the',
    'conditions you lived in were intolerable',
    'and that at some other time they must have',
    'been different. It struck him that the truly',
    'characteristic thing about modern life was',
    'not its cruelty and insecurity, but simply',
    'its bareness, its dinginess, its listlessness.',
    'Life, if you looked about you, bore no resemblance',
    'not only to the lies that streamed out of',
    'the telescreens, but even to the ideals that',
    'the Party was trying to achieve. Great areas',
    'of it, even for a Party member, were neutral',
    'and non-political, a matter of slogging through',
    'dreary jobs, fighting for a place on the',
    'Tube, darning a worn-out sock, cadging a',
    'saccharine tablet, saving a cigarette end.',
    'The ideal set up by the Party was something',
    'huge, terrible, and glittering, a world of',
    'steel and concrete, of monstrous machines',
    'and terrifying weapons, a nation of warriors',
    'and fanatics, marching forward in perfect',
    'unity, all thinking the same thoughts and',
    'shouting the same slogans, perpetually working,',
    'fighting, triumphing, persecuting, three',
    'hundred million people all with the same',
    'face. The reality was decaying, dingy cities',
    'where underfed people shuffled to and fro',
    'in leaky shoes, in patched-up nineteenth-century',
    'houses that smelt always of cabbage and bad',
    'lavatories. He seemed to see a vision of',
    'London, vast and ruinous, city of a million',
    'dustbins, and mixed up with it was a picture',
    'of Mrs Parsons, a woman with lined face and',
    'wispy hair, fiddling helplessly with a blocked',
    'waste-pipe. He reached down and scratched',
    'his ankle again. Day and night the telescreens',
    'bruised your ears with statistics proving',
    'that people today had more food, more clothes,',
    'better houses, better recreations, that they',
    'lived longer, worked shorter hours, were',
    'bigger, healthier, stronger, happier, more',
    'intelligent, better educated, than the people',
    'of fifty years ago. Not a word of it could',
    'ever be proved or disproved. The Party claimed,',
    'for example, that today 40 per cent of adult',
    'proles were literate: before the Revolution,',
    'it was said, the number had only been 15',
    'per cent. The Party claimed that the infant',
    'mortality rate was now only 160 per thousand,',
    'whereas before the Revolution it had been',
    '300, and so it went on. It was like a single',
    'equation with two unknowns. It might very',
    'well be that literally every word in the',
    'history books, even the things that one accepted',
    'without question, was pure fantasy. For all',
    'he knew there might never have been any such',
    'law as the JUS PRIMAE NOCTIS, or any such',
    'creature as a capitalist, or any such garment',
    'as a top hat. Everything faded into mist.',
    'The past was erased, the erasure was forgotten,',
    'the lie became truth. Just once in his life',
    'he had possessed, AFTER the event: that was',
    'what counted, concrete, unmistakable evidence',
    'of an act of falsification. He had held it',
    'between his fingers for as long as thirty',
    'seconds. In 1973, it must have been, at any',
    'rate, it was at about the time when he and',
    'Katharine had parted. But the really relevant',
    'date was seven or eight years earlier. The',
    'story really began in the middle sixties,',
    'the period of the great purges in which the',
    'original leaders of the Revolution were wiped',
    'out once and for all. By 1970 none of them',
    'was left, except Big Brother himself. All',
    'the rest had by that time been exposed as',
    'traitors and counter-revolutionaries. Goldstein',
    'had fled and was hiding no one knew where,',
    'and of the others, a few had simply disappeared,',
    'while the majority had been executed after',
    'spectacular public trials at which they made',
    'confession of their crimes. Among the last',
    'survivors were three men named Jones, Aaronson,',
    'and Rutherford. It must have been in 1965',
    'that these three had been arrested. As often',
    'happened, they had vanished for a year or',
    'more, so that one did not know whether they',
    'were alive or dead, and then had suddenly',
    'been brought forth to incriminate themselves',
    'in the usual way. They had confessed to intelligence',
    'with the enemy (at that date, too, the enemy',
    'was Eurasia), embezzlement of public funds,',
    'the murder of various trusted Party members,',
    'intrigues against the leadership of Big Brother',
    'which had started long before the Revolution',
    'happened, and acts of sabotage causing the',
    'death of hundreds of thousands of people.',
    'After confessing to these things they had',
    'been pardoned, reinstated in the Party, and',
    'given posts which were in fact sinecures',
    'but which sounded important. All three had',
    'written long, abject articles in \'The Times\',',
    'analysing the reasons for their defection',
    'and promising to make amends. Some time after',
    'their release Winston had actually seen all',
    'three of them in the Chestnut Tree Cafe.',
    'He remembered the sort of terrified fascination',
    'with which he had watched them out of the',
    'corner of his eye. They were men far older',
    'than himself, relics of the ancient world,',
    'almost the last great figures left over from',
    'the heroic days of the Party. The glamour',
    'of the underground struggle and the civil',
    'war still faintly clung to them. He had the',
    'feeling, though already at that time facts',
    'and dates were growing blurry, that he had',
    'known their names years earlier than he had',
    'known that of Big Brother. But also they',
    'were outlaws, enemies, untouchables, doomed',
    'with absolute certainty to extinction within',
    'a year or two. No one who had once fallen',
    'into the hands of the Thought Police ever',
    'escaped in the end. They were corpses waiting',
    'to be sent back to the grave. There was no',
    'one at any of the tables nearest to them.',
    'It was not wise even to be seen in the neighbourhood',
    'of such people. They were sitting in silence',
    'before glasses of the gin flavoured with',
    'cloves which was the speciality of the cafe.',
    'Of the three, it was Rutherford whose appearance',
    'had most impressed Winston. Rutherford had',
    'once been a famous caricaturist, whose brutal',
    'cartoons had helped to inflame popular opinion',
    'before and during the Revolution. Even now,',
    'at long intervals, his cartoons were appearing',
    'in The Times. They were simply an imitation',
    'of his earlier manner, and curiously lifeless',
    'and unconvincing. Always they were a rehashing',
    'of the ancient themes, slum tenements, starving',
    'children, street battles, capitalists in',
    'top hats, even on the barricades the capitalists',
    'still seemed to cling to their top hats an',
    'endless, hopeless effort to get back into',
    'the past. He was a monstrous man, with a',
    'mane of greasy grey hair, his face pouched',
    'and seamed, with thick negroid lips. At one',
    'time he must have been immensely strong;',
    'now his great body was sagging, sloping,',
    'bulging, falling away in every direction.',
    'He seemed to be breaking up before one\'s',
    'eyes, like a mountain crumbling. It was the',
    'lonely hour of fifteen. Winston could not',
    'now remember how he had come to be in the',
    'cafe at such a time. The place was almost',
    'empty. A tinny music was trickling from the',
    'telescreens. The three men sat in their corner',
    'almost motionless, never speaking. Uncommanded,',
    'the waiter brought fresh glasses of gin.',
    'There was a chessboard on the table beside',
    'them, with the pieces set out but no game',
    'started. And then, for perhaps half a minute',
    'in all, something happened to the telescreens.',
    'The tune that they were playing changed,',
    'and the tone of the music changed too. There',
    'came into it, but it was something hard to',
    'describe. It was a peculiar, cracked, braying,',
    'jeering note: in his mind Winston called',
    'it a yellow note. And then a voice from the',
    'telescreen was singing: Under the spreading',
    'chestnut tree I sold you and you sold me:',
    'There lie they, and here lie we Under the',
    'spreading chestnut tree. The three men never',
    'stirred. But when Winston glanced again at',
    'Rutherford\'s ruinous face, he saw that his',
    'eyes were full of tears. And for the first',
    'time he noticed, with a kind of inward shudder,',
    'and yet not knowing AT WHAT he shuddered,',
    'that both Aaronson and Rutherford had broken',
    'noses. A little later all three were re-arrested.',
    'It appeared that they had engaged in fresh',
    'conspiracies from the very moment of their',
    'release. At their second trial they confessed',
    'to all their old crimes over again, with',
    'a whole string of new ones. They were executed,',
    'and their fate was recorded in the Party',
    'histories, a warning to posterity. About',
    'five years after this, in 1973, Winston was',
    'unrolling a wad of documents which had just',
    'flopped out of the pneumatic tube on to his',
    'desk when he came on a fragment of paper',
    'which had evidently been slipped in among',
    'the others and then forgotten. The instant',
    'he had flattened it out he saw its significance.',
    'It was a half-page torn out of \'The Times\'',
    'of about ten years earlier, the top half',
    'of the page, so that it included the date,',
    'and it contained a photograph of the delegates',
    'at some Party function in New York. Prominent',
    'in the middle of the group were Jones, Aaronson,',
    'and Rutherford. There was no mistaking them,',
    'in any case their names were in the caption',
    'at the bottom. The point was that at both',
    'trials all three men had confessed that on',
    'that date they had been on Eurasian soil.',
    'They had flown from a secret airfield in',
    'Canada to a rendezvous somewhere in Siberia,',
    'and had conferred with members of the Eurasian',
    'General Staff, to whom they had betrayed',
    'important military secrets. The date had',
    'stuck in Winston\'s memory because it chanced',
    'to be midsummer day; but the whole story',
    'must be on record in countless other places',
    'as well. There was only one possible conclusion:',
    'the confessions were lies. Of course, this',
    'was not in itself a discovery. Even at that',
    'time Winston had not imagined that the people',
    'who were wiped out in the purges had actually',
    'committed the crimes that they were accused',
    'of. But this was concrete evidence; it was',
    'a fragment of the abolished past, like a',
    'fossil bone which turns up in the wrong stratum',
    'and destroys a geological theory. It was',
    'enough to blow the Party to atoms, if in',
    'some way it could have been published to',
    'the world and its significance made known.',
    'He had gone straight on working. As soon',
    'as he saw what the photograph was, and what',
    'it meant, he had covered it up with another',
    'sheet of paper. Luckily, when he unrolled',
    'it, it had been upside-down from the point',
    'of view of the telescreen. He took his scribbling',
    'pad on his knee and pushed back his chair',
    'so as to get as far away from the telescreen',
    'as possible. To keep your face expressionless',
    'was not difficult, and even your breathing',
    'could be controlled, with an effort: but',
    'you could not control the beating of your',
    'heart, and the telescreen was quite delicate',
    'enough to pick it up. He let what he judged',
    'to be ten minutes go by, tormented all the',
    'while by the fear that some accident, a sudden',
    'draught blowing across his desk, for instance,',
    'would betray him. Then, without uncovering',
    'it again, he dropped the photograph into',
    'the memory hole, along with some other waste',
    'papers. Within another minute, perhaps, it',
    'would have crumbled into ashes. That was',
    'ten, eleven years ago. Today, probably, he',
    'would have kept that photograph. It was curious',
    'that the fact of having held it in his fingers',
    'seemed to him to make a difference even now,',
    'when the photograph itself, as well as the',
    'event it recorded, was only memory. Was the',
    'Party\'s hold upon the past less strong, he',
    'wondered, because a piece of evidence which',
    'existed no longer HAD ONCE existed? But today,',
    'supposing that it could be somehow resurrected',
    'from its ashes, the photograph might not',
    'even be evidence. Already, at the time when',
    'he made his discovery, Oceania was no longer',
    'at war with Eurasia, and it must have been',
    'to the agents of Eastasia that the three',
    'dead men had betrayed their country. Since',
    'then there had been other changes, two, three,',
    'he could not remember how many. Very likely',
    'the confessions had been rewritten and rewritten',
    'until the original facts and dates no longer',
    'had the smallest significance. The past not',
    'only changed, but changed continuously. What',
    'most afflicted him with the sense of nightmare',
    'was that he had never clearly understood',
    'why the huge imposture was undertaken. The',
    'immediate advantages of falsifying the past',
    'were obvious, but the ultimate motive was',
    'mysterious. He took up his pen again and',
    'wrote: I understand HOW: I do not understand',
    'WHY. He wondered, as he had many times wondered',
    'before, whether he himself was a lunatic.',
    'Perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of',
    'one. At one time it had been a sign of madness',
    'to believe that the earth goes round the',
    'sun; today, to believe that the past is unalterable.',
    'He might be ALONE in holding that belief,',
    'and if alone, then a lunatic. But the thought',
    'of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble',
    'him: the horror was that he might also be',
    'wrong. He picked up the children\'s history',
    'book and looked at the portrait of Big Brother',
    'which formed its frontispiece. The hypnotic',
    'eyes gazed into his own. It was as though',
    'some huge force were pressing down upon you,',
    'something that penetrated inside your skull,',
    'battering against your brain, frightening',
    'you out of your beliefs, persuading you,',
    'almost, to deny the evidence of your senses.',
    'In the end the Party would announce that',
    'two and two made five, and you would have',
    'to believe it. It was inevitable that they',
    'should make that claim sooner or later: the',
    'logic of their position demanded it. Not',
    'merely the validity of experience, but the',
    'very existence of external reality, was tacitly',
    'denied by their philosophy. The heresy of',
    'heresies was common sense. And what was terrifying',
    'was not that they would kill you for thinking',
    'otherwise, but that they might be right.',
    'For, after all, how do we know that two and',
    'two make four? Or that the force of gravity',
    'works? Or that the past is unchangeable?',
    'If both the past and the external world exist',
    'only in the mind, and if the mind itself',
    'is controllable what then? But no! His courage',
    'seemed suddenly to stiffen of its own accord.',
    'The face of O\'Brien, not called up by any',
    'obvious association, had floated into his',
    'mind. He knew, with more certainty than before,',
    'that O\'Brien was on his side. He was writing',
    'the diary for O\'Brien, TO O\'Brien: it was',
    'like an interminable letter which no one',
    'would ever read, but which was addressed',
    'to a particular person and took its colour',
    'from that fact. The Party told you to reject',
    'the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was',
    'their final, most essential command. His',
    'heart sank as he thought of the enormous',
    'power arrayed against him, the ease with',
    'which any Party intellectual would overthrow',
    'him in debate, the subtle arguments which',
    'he would not be able to understand, much',
    'less answer. And yet he was in the right!',
    'They were wrong and he was right. The obvious,',
    'the silly, and the true had got to be defended.',
    'Truisms are true, hold on to that! The solid',
    'world exists, its laws do not change. Stones',
    'are hard, water is wet, objects unsupported',
    'fall towards the earth\'s centre. With the',
    'feeling that he was speaking to O\'Brien,',
    'and also that he was setting forth an important',
    'axiom, he wrote: Freedom is the freedom to',
    'say that two plus two make four. If that',
    'is granted, all else follows. Chapter 8 From',
    'somewhere at the bottom of a passage the',
    'smell of roasting coffee, real coffee, not',
    'Victory Coffee, came floating out into the',
    'street. Winston paused involuntarily. For',
    'perhaps two seconds he was back in the half-forgotten',
    'world of his childhood. Then a door banged,',
    'seeming to cut off the smell as abruptly',
    'as though it had been a sound. He had walked',
    'several kilometres over pavements, and his',
    'varicose ulcer was throbbing. This was the',
    'second time in three weeks that he had missed',
    'an evening at the Community Centre: a rash',
    'act, since you could be certain that the',
    'number of your attendances at the Centre',
    'was carefully checked. In principle a Party',
    'member had no spare time, and was never alone',
    'except in bed. It was assumed that when he',
    'was not working, eating, or sleeping he would',
    'be taking part in some kind of communal recreation:',
    'to do anything that suggested a taste for',
    'solitude, even to go for a walk by yourself,',
    'was always slightly dangerous. There was',
    'a word for it in Newspeak: OWNLIFE, it was',
    'called, meaning individualism and eccentricity.',
    'But this evening as he came out of the Ministry',
    'the balminess of the April air had tempted',
    'him. The sky was a warmer blue than he had',
    'seen it that year, and suddenly the long,',
    'noisy evening at the Centre, the boring,',
    'exhausting games, the lectures, the creaking',
    'camaraderie oiled by gin, had seemed intolerable.',
    'On impulse he had turned away from the bus-stop',
    'and wandered off into the labyrinth of London,',
    'first south, then east, then north again,',
    'losing himself among unknown streets and',
    'hardly bothering in which direction he was',
    'going. \'If there is hope,\' he had written',
    'in the diary, \'it lies in the proles.\' The',
    'words kept coming back to him, statement',
    'of a mystical truth and a palpable absurdity.',
    'He was somewhere in the vague, brown-coloured',
    'slums to the north and east of what had once',
    'been Saint Pancras Station. He was walking',
    'up a cobbled street of little two-storey',
    'houses with battered doorways which gave',
    'straight on the pavement and which were somehow',
    'curiously suggestive of ratholes. There were',
    'puddles of filthy water here and there among',
    'the cobbles. In and out of the dark doorways,',
    'and down narrow alley-ways that branched',
    'off on either side, people swarmed in astonishing',
    'numbers, girls in full bloom, with crudely',
    'lipsticked mouths, and youths who chased',
    'the girls, and swollen waddling women who',
    'showed you what the girls would be like in',
    'ten years\' time, and old bent creatures shuffling',
    'along on splayed feet, and ragged barefooted',
    'children who played in the puddles and then',
    'scattered at angry yells from their mothers.',
    'Perhaps a quarter of the windows in the street',
    'were broken and boarded up. Most of the people',
    'paid no attention to Winston; a few eyed',
    'him with a sort of guarded curiosity. Two',
    'monstrous women with brick-red forearms folded',
    'across their aprons were talking outside',
    'a doorway. Winston caught scraps of conversation',
    'as he approached. \'"Yes," I says to \'er,',
    '"that\'s all very well," I says. "But if you\'d',
    'of been in my place you\'d of done the same',
    'as what I done. It\'s easy to criticize,"',
    'I says, "but you ain\'t got the same problems',
    'as what I got."\' \'Ah,\' said the other, \'that\'s',
    'jest it. That\'s jest where it is.\' The strident',
    'voices stopped abruptly. The women studied',
    'him in hostile silence as he went past. But',
    'it was not hostility, exactly; merely a kind',
    'of wariness, a momentary stiffening, as at',
    'the passing of some unfamiliar animal. The',
    'blue overalls of the Party could not be a',
    'common sight in a street like this. Indeed,',
    'it was unwise to be seen in such places,',
    'unless you had definite business there. The',
    'patrols might stop you if you happened to',
    'run into them. \'May I see your papers, comrade?',
    'What are you doing here? What time did you',
    'leave work? Is this your usual way home?\',',
    'and so on and so forth. Not that there was',
    'any rule against walking home by an unusual',
    'route: but it was enough to draw attention',
    'to you if the Thought Police heard about',
    'it. Suddenly the whole street was in commotion.',
    'There were yells of warning from all sides.',
    'People were shooting into the doorways like',
    'rabbits. A young woman leapt out of a doorway',
    'a little ahead of Winston, grabbed up a tiny',
    'child playing in a puddle, whipped her apron',
    'round it, and leapt back again, all in one',
    'movement. At the same instant a man in a',
    'concertina-like black suit, who had emerged',
    'from a side alley, ran towards Winston, pointing',
    'excitedly to the sky. \'Steamer!\' he yelled.',
    '\'Look out, guv\'nor! Bang over\'ead! Lay down',
    'quick!\' \'Steamer\' was a nickname which, for',
    'some reason, the proles applied to rocket',
    'bombs. Winston promptly flung himself on',
    'his face. The proles were nearly always right',
    'when they gave you a warning of this kind.',
    'They seemed to possess some kind of instinct',
    'which told them several seconds in advance',
    'when a rocket was coming, although the rockets',
    'supposedly travelled faster than sound. Winston',
    'clasped his forearms above his head. There',
    'was a roar that seemed to make the pavement',
    'heave; a shower of light objects pattered',
    'on to his back. When he stood up he found',
    'that he was covered with fragments of glass',
    'from the nearest window. He walked on. The',
    'bomb had demolished a group of houses 200',
    'metres up the street. A black plume of smoke',
    'hung in the sky, and below it a cloud of',
    'plaster dust in which a crowd was already',
    'forming around the ruins. There was a little',
    'pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead',
    'of him, and in the middle of it he could',
    'see a bright red streak. When he got up to',
    'it he saw that it was a human hand severed',
    'at the wrist. Apart from the bloody stump,',
    'the hand was so completely whitened as to',
    'resemble a plaster cast. He kicked the thing',
    'into the gutter, and then, to avoid the crowd,',
    'turned down a side-street to the right. Within',
    'three or four minutes he was out of the area',
    'which the bomb had affected, and the sordid',
    'swarming life of the streets was going on',
    'as though nothing had happened. It was nearly',
    'twenty hours, and the drinking-shops which',
    'the proles frequented (\'pubs\', they called',
    'them) were choked with customers. From their',
    'grimy swing doors, endlessly opening and',
    'shutting, there came forth a smell of urine,',
    'sawdust, and sour beer. In an angle formed',
    'by a projecting house-front three men were',
    'standing very close together, the middle',
    'one of them holding a folded-up newspaper',
    'which the other two were studying over his',
    'shoulder. Even before he was near enough',
    'to make out the expression on their faces,',
    'Winston could see absorption in every line',
    'of their bodies. It was obviously some serious',
    'piece of news that they were reading. He',
    'was a few paces away from them when suddenly',
    'the group broke up and two of the men were',
    'in violent altercation. For a moment they',
    'seemed almost on the point of blows. \'Can\'t',
    'you bleeding well listen to what I say? I',
    'tell you no number ending in seven ain\'t',
    'won for over fourteen months!\' \'Yes, it \'as,',
    'then!\' \'No, it \'as not! Back \'ome I got the',
    '\'ole lot of \'em for over two years wrote',
    'down on a piece of paper. I takes \'em down',
    'reg\'lar as the clock. An\' I tell you, no',
    'number ending in seven, , \' \'Yes, a seven',
    '\'AS won! I could pretty near tell you the',
    'bleeding number. Four oh seven, it ended',
    'in. It were in February, second week in February.\'',
    '\'February your grandmother! I got it all',
    'down in black and white. An\' I tell you,',
    'no number, , \' \'Oh, pack it in!\' said the',
    'third man. They were talking about the Lottery.',
    'Winston looked back when he had gone thirty',
    'metres. They were still arguing, with vivid,',
    'passionate faces. The Lottery, with its weekly',
    'pay-out of enormous prizes, was the one public',
    'event to which the proles paid serious attention.',
    'It was probable that there were some millions',
    'of proles for whom the Lottery was the principal',
    'if not the only reason for remaining alive.',
    'It was their delight, their folly, their',
    'anodyne, their intellectual stimulant. Where',
    'the Lottery was concerned, even people who',
    'could barely read and write seemed capable',
    'of intricate calculations and staggering',
    'feats of memory. There was a whole tribe',
    'of men who made a living simply by selling',
    'systems, forecasts, and lucky amulets. Winston',
    'had nothing to do with the running of the',
    'Lottery, which was managed by the Ministry',
    'of Plenty, but he was aware (indeed everyone',
    'in the party was aware) that the prizes were',
    'largely imaginary. Only small sums were actually',
    'paid out, the winners of the big prizes being',
    'non-existent persons. In the absence of any',
    'real intercommunication between one part',
    'of Oceania and another, this was not difficult',
    'to arrange. But if there was hope, it lay',
    'in the proles. You had to cling on to that.',
    'When you put it in words it sounded reasonable:',
    'it was when you looked at the human beings',
    'passing you on the pavement that it became',
    'an act of faith. The street into which he',
    'had turned ran downhill. He had a feeling',
    'that he had been in this neighbourhood before,',
    'and that there was a main thoroughfare not',
    'far away. From somewhere ahead there came',
    'a din of shouting voices. The street took',
    'a sharp turn and then ended in a flight of',
    'steps which led down into a sunken alley',
    'where a few stall-keepers were selling tired-looking',
    'vegetables. At this moment Winston remembered',
    'where he was. The alley led out into the',
    'main street, and down the next turning, not',
    'five minutes away, was the junk-shop where',
    'he had bought the blank book which was now',
    'his diary. And in a small stationer\'s shop',
    'not far away he had bought his penholder',
    'and his bottle of ink. He paused for a moment',
    'at the top of the steps. On the opposite',
    'side of the alley there was a dingy little',
    'pub whose windows appeared to be frosted',
    'over but in reality were merely coated with',
    'dust. A very old man, bent but active, with',
    'white moustaches that bristled forward like',
    'those of a prawn, pushed open the swing door',
    'and went in. As Winston stood watching, it',
    'occurred to him that the old man, who must',
    'be eighty at the least, had already been',
    'middle-aged when the Revolution happened.',
    'He and a few others like him were the last',
    'links that now existed with the vanished',
    'world of capitalism. In the Party itself',
    'there were not many people left whose ideas',
    'had been formed before the Revolution. The',
    'older generation had mostly been wiped out',
    'in the great purges of the fifties and sixties,',
    'and the few who survived had long ago been',
    'terrified into complete intellectual surrender.',
    'If there was any one still alive who could',
    'give you a truthful account of conditions',
    'in the early part of the century, it could',
    'only be a prole. Suddenly the passage from',
    'the history book that he had copied into',
    'his diary came back into Winston\'s mind,',
    'and a lunatic impulse took hold of him. He',
    'would go into the pub, he would scrape acquaintance',
    'with that old man and question him. He would',
    'say to him: \'Tell me about your life when',
    'you were a boy. What was it like in those',
    'days? Were things better than they are now,',
    'or were they worse?\' Hurriedly, lest he should',
    'have time to become frightened, he descended',
    'the steps and crossed the narrow street.',
    'It was madness of course. As usual, there',
    'was no definite rule against talking to proles',
    'and frequenting their pubs, but it was far',
    'too unusual an action to pass unnoticed.',
    'If the patrols appeared he might plead an',
    'attack of faintness, but it was not likely',
    'that they would believe him. He pushed open',
    'the door, and a hideous cheesy smell of sour',
    'beer hit him in the face. As he entered the',
    'din of voices dropped to about half its volume.',
    'Behind his back he could feel everyone eyeing',
    'his blue overalls. A game of darts which',
    'was going on at the other end of the room',
    'interrupted itself for perhaps as much as',
    'thirty seconds. The old man whom he had followed',
    'was standing at the bar, having some kind',
    'of altercation with the barman, a large,',
    'stout, hook-nosed young man with enormous',
    'forearms. A knot of others, standing round',
    'with glasses in their hands, were watching',
    'the scene. \'I arst you civil enough, didn\'t',
    'I?\' said the old man, straightening his shoulders',
    'pugnaciously. \'You telling me you ain\'t got',
    'a pint mug in the \'ole bleeding boozer?\'',
    '\'And what in hell\'s name IS a pint?\' said',
    'the barman, leaning forward with the tips',
    'of his fingers on the counter. \'\'Ark at \'im!',
    'Calls \'isself a barman and don\'t know what',
    'a pint is! Why, a pint\'s the \'alf of a quart,',
    'and there\'s four quarts to the gallon. \'Ave',
    'to teach you the A, B, C next.\' \'Never heard',
    'of \'em,\' said the barman shortly. \'Litre',
    'and half litre, that\'s all we serve. There\'s',
    'the glasses on the shelf in front of you.\'',
    '\'I likes a pint,\' persisted the old man.',
    '\'You could \'a drawed me off a pint easy enough.',
    'We didn\'t \'ave these bleeding litres when',
    'I was a young man.\' \'When you were a young',
    'man we were all living in the treetops,\'',
    'said the barman, with a glance at the other',
    'customers. There was a shout of laughter,',
    'and the uneasiness caused by Winston\'s entry',
    'seemed to disappear. The old man\'s white-stubbled',
    'face had flushed pink. He turned away, muttering',
    'to himself, and bumped into Winston. Winston',
    'caught him gently by the arm. \'May I offer',
    'you a drink?\' he said. \'You\'re a gent,\' said',
    'the other, straightening his shoulders again.',
    'He appeared not to have noticed Winston\'s',
    'blue overalls. \'Pint!\' he added aggressively',
    'to the barman. \'Pint of wallop.\' The barman',
    'swished two half-litres of dark-brown beer',
    'into thick glasses which he had rinsed in',
    'a bucket under the counter. Beer was the',
    'only drink you could get in prole pubs. The',
    'proles were supposed not to drink gin, though',
    'in practice they could get hold of it easily',
    'enough. The game of darts was in full swing',
    'again, and the knot of men at the bar had',
    'begun talking about lottery tickets. Winston\'s',
    'presence was forgotten for a moment. There',
    'was a deal table under the window where he',
    'and the old man could talk without fear of',
    'being overheard. It was horribly dangerous,',
    'but at any rate there was no telescreen in',
    'the room, a point he had made sure of as',
    'soon as he came in. \'\'E could \'a drawed me',
    'off a pint,\' grumbled the old man as he settled',
    'down behind a glass. \'A \'alf litre ain\'t',
    'enough. It don\'t satisfy. And a \'ole litre\'s',
    'too much. It starts my bladder running. Let',
    'alone the price.\' \'You must have seen great',
    'changes since you were a young man,\' said',
    'Winston tentatively. The old man\'s pale blue',
    'eyes moved from the darts board to the bar,',
    'and from the bar to the door of the Gents,',
    'as though it were in the bar-room that he',
    'expected the changes to have occurred. \'The',
    'beer was better,\' he said finally. \'And cheaper!',
    'When I was a young man, mild beer, wallop',
    'we used to call it, was fourpence a pint.',
    'That was before the war, of course.\' \'Which',
    'war was that?\' said Winston. \'It\'s all wars,\'',
    'said the old man vaguely. He took up his',
    'glass, and his shoulders straightened again.',
    '\'\'Ere\'s wishing you the very best of \'ealth!\'',
    'In his lean throat the sharp-pointed Adam\'s',
    'apple made a surprisingly rapid up-and-down',
    'movement, and the beer vanished. Winston',
    'went to the bar and came back with two more',
    'half-litres. The old man appeared to have',
    'forgotten his prejudice against drinking',
    'a full litre. \'You are very much older than',
    'I am,\' said Winston. \'You must have been',
    'a grown man before I was born. You can remember',
    'what it was like in the old days, before',
    'the Revolution. People of my age don\'t really',
    'know anything about those times. We can only',
    'read about them in books, and what it says',
    'in the books may not be true. I should like',
    'your opinion on that. The history books say',
    'that life before the Revolution was completely',
    'different from what it is now. There was',
    'the most terrible oppression, injustice,',
    'poverty worse than anything we can imagine.',
    'Here in London, the great mass of the people',
    'never had enough to eat from birth to death.',
    'Half of them hadn\'t even boots on their feet.',
    'They worked twelve hours a day, they left',
    'school at nine, they slept ten in a room.',
    'And at the same time there were a very few',
    'people, only a few thousands, the capitalists,',
    'they were called, who were rich and powerful.',
    'They owned everything that there was to own.',
    'They lived in great gorgeous houses with',
    'thirty servants, they rode about in motor-cars',
    'and four-horse carriages, they drank champagne,',
    'they wore top hats, , \' The old man brightened',
    'suddenly. \'Top \'ats!\' he said. \'Funny you',
    'should mention \'em. The same thing come into',
    'my \'ead only yesterday, I dono why. I was',
    'jest thinking, I ain\'t seen a top \'at in',
    'years. Gorn right out, they \'ave. The last',
    'time I wore one was at my sister-in-law\'s',
    'funeral. And that was, well, I couldn\'t give',
    'you the date, but it must\'a been fifty years',
    'ago. Of course it was only \'ired for the',
    'occasion, you understand.\' \'It isn\'t very',
    'important about the top hats,\' said Winston',
    'patiently. \'The point is, these capitalists,',
    'they and a few lawyers and priests and so',
    'forth who lived on them, were the lords of',
    'the earth. Everything existed for their benefit.',
    'You, the ordinary people, the workers, were',
    'their slaves. They could do what they liked',
    'with you. They could ship you off to Canada',
    'like cattle. They could sleep with your daughters',
    'if they chose. They could order you to be',
    'flogged with something called a cat-o\'-nine',
    'tails. You had to take your cap off when',
    'you passed them. Every capitalist went about',
    'with a gang of lackeys who, , \' The old man',
    'brightened again. \'Lackeys!\' he said. \'Now',
    'there\'s a word I ain\'t \'eard since ever so',
    'long. Lackeys! That reg\'lar takes me back,',
    'that does. I recollect, oh, donkey\'s years',
    'ago, I used to sometimes go to \'Yde Park',
    'of a Sunday afternoon to \'ear the blokes',
    'making speeches. Salvation Army, Roman Catholics,',
    'Jews, Indians, all sorts there was. And there',
    'was one bloke, well, I couldn\'t give you',
    '\'is name, but a real powerful speaker \'e',
    'was. \'E didn\'t \'alf give it \'em! "Lackeys!"',
    '\'e says, "lackeys of the bourgeoisie! Flunkies',
    'of the ruling class!" Parasites, that was',
    'another of them. And \'yenas, \'e definitely',
    'called \'em \'yenas. Of course \'e was referring',
    'to the Labour Party, you understand.\' Winston',
    'had the feeling that they were talking at',
    'cross-purposes. \'What I really wanted to',
    'know was this,\' he said. \'Do you feel that',
    'you have more freedom now than you had in',
    'those days? Are you treated more like a human',
    'being? In the old days, the rich people,',
    'the people at the top, , \' \'The \'Ouse of',
    'Lords,\' put in the old man reminiscently.',
    '\'The House of Lords, if you like. What I',
    'am asking is, were these people able to treat',
    'you as an inferior, simply because they were',
    'rich and you were poor? Is it a fact, for',
    'instance, that you had to call them "Sir"',
    'and take off your cap when you passed them?\'',
    'The old man appeared to think deeply. He',
    'drank off about a quarter of his beer before',
    'answering. \'Yes,\' he said. \'They liked you',
    'to touch your cap to \'em. It showed respect,',
    'like. I didn\'t agree with it, myself, but',
    'I done it often enough. Had to, as you might',
    'say.\' \'And was it usual, I\'m only quoting',
    'what I\'ve read in history books, was it usual',
    'for these people and their servants to push',
    'you off the pavement into the gutter?\' \'One',
    'of \'em pushed me once,\' said the old man.',
    '\'I recollect it as if it was yesterday. It',
    'was Boat Race night, terribly rowdy they',
    'used to get on Boat Race night, and I bumps',
    'into a young bloke on Shaftesbury Avenue.',
    'Quite a gent, \'e was, dress shirt, top \'at,',
    'black overcoat. \'E was kind of zig-zagging',
    'across the pavement, and I bumps into \'im',
    'accidental-like. \'E says, "Why can\'t you',
    'look where you\'re going?" \'e says. I say,',
    '"Ju think you\'ve bought the bleeding pavement?"',
    '\'E says, "I\'ll twist your bloody \'ead off',
    'if you get fresh with me." I says, "You\'re',
    'drunk. I\'ll give you in charge in \'alf a',
    'minute," I says. An\' if you\'ll believe me,',
    '\'e puts \'is \'and on my chest and gives me',
    'a shove as pretty near sent me under the',
    'wheels of a bus. Well, I was young in them',
    'days, and I was going to \'ave fetched \'im',
    'one, only, , \' A sense of helplessness took',
    'hold of Winston. The old man\'s memory was',
    'nothing but a rubbish-heap of details. One',
    'could question him all day without getting',
    'any real information. The party histories',
    'might still be true, after a fashion: they',
    'might even be completely true. He made a',
    'last attempt. \'Perhaps I have not made myself',
    'clear,\' he said. \'What I\'m trying to say',
    'is this. You have been alive a very long',
    'time; you lived half your life before the',
    'Revolution. In 1925, for instance, you were',
    'already grown up. Would you say from what',
    'you can remember, that life in 1925 was better',
    'than it is now, or worse? If you could choose,',
    'would you prefer to live then or now?\' The',
    'old man looked meditatively at the darts',
    'board. He finished up his beer, more slowly',
    'than before. When he spoke it was with a',
    'tolerant philosophical air, as though the',
    'beer had mellowed him. \'I know what you expect',
    'me to say,\' he said. \'You expect me to say',
    'as I\'d sooner be young again. Most people\'d',
    'say they\'d sooner be young, if you arst \'em.',
    'You got your \'ealth and strength when you\'re',
    'young. When you get to my time of life you',
    'ain\'t never well. I suffer something wicked',
    'from my feet, and my bladder\'s jest terrible.',
    'Six and seven times a night it \'as me out',
    'of bed. On the other \'and, there\'s great',
    'advantages in being a old man. You ain\'t',
    'got the same worries. No truck with women,',
    'and that\'s a great thing. I ain\'t \'ad a woman',
    'for near on thirty year, if you\'d credit',
    'it. Nor wanted to, what\'s more.\' Winston',
    'sat back against the window-sill. It was',
    'no use going on. He was about to buy some',
    'more beer when the old man suddenly got up',
    'and shuffled rapidly into the stinking urinal',
    'at the side of the room. The extra half-litre',
    'was already working on him. Winston sat for',
    'a minute or two gazing at his empty glass,',
    'and hardly noticed when his feet carried',
    'him out into the street again. Within twenty',
    'years at the most, he reflected, the huge',
    'and simple question, \'Was life better before',
    'the Revolution than it is now?\' would have',
    'ceased once and for all to be answerable.',
    'But in effect it was unanswerable even now,',
    'since the few scattered survivors from the',
    'ancient world were incapable of comparing',
    'one age with another. They remembered a million',
    'useless things, a quarrel with a workmate,',
    'a hunt for a lost bicycle pump, the expression',
    'on a long-dead sister\'s face, the swirls',
    'of dust on a windy morning seventy years',
    'ago: but all the relevant facts were outside',
    'the range of their vision. They were like',
    'the ant, which can see small objects but',
    'not large ones. And when memory failed and',
    'written records were falsified, when that',
    'happened, the claim of the Party to have',
    'improved the conditions of human life had',
    'got to be accepted, because there did not',
    'exist, and never again could exist, any standard',
    'against which it could be tested. At this',
    'moment his train of thought stopped abruptly.',
    'He halted and looked up. He was in a narrow',
    'street, with a few dark little shops, interspersed',
    'among dwelling-houses. Immediately above',
    'his head there hung three discoloured metal',
    'balls which looked as if they had once been',
    'gilded. He seemed to know the place. Of course!',
    'He was standing outside the junk-shop where',
    'he had bought the diary. A twinge of fear',
    'went through him. It had been a sufficiently',
    'rash act to buy the book in the beginning,',
    'and he had sworn never to come near the place',
    'again. And yet the instant that he allowed',
    'his thoughts to wander, his feet had brought',
    'him back here of their own accord. It was',
    'precisely against suicidal impulses of this',
    'kind that he had hoped to guard himself by',
    'opening the diary. At the same time he noticed',
    'that although it was nearly twenty-one hours',
    'the shop was still open. With the feeling',
    'that he would be less conspicuous inside',
    'than hanging about on the pavement, he stepped',
    'through the doorway. If questioned, he could',
    'plausibly say that he was trying to buy razor',
    'blades. The proprietor had just lighted a',
    'hanging oil lamp which gave off an unclean',
    'but friendly smell. He was a man of perhaps',
    'sixty, frail and bowed, with a long, benevolent',
    'nose, and mild eyes distorted by thick spectacles.',
    'His hair was almost white, but his eyebrows',
    'were bushy and still black. His spectacles,',
    'his gentle, fussy movements, and the fact',
    'that he was wearing an aged jacket of black',
    'velvet, gave him a vague air of intellectuality,',
    'as though he had been some kind of literary',
    'man, or perhaps a musician. His voice was',
    'soft, as though faded, and his accent less',
    'debased than that of the majority of proles.',
    '\'I recognized you on the pavement,\' he said',
    'immediately. \'You\'re the gentleman that bought',
    'the young lady\'s keepsake album. That was',
    'a beautiful bit of paper, that was. Cream-laid,',
    'it used to be called. There\'s been no paper',
    'like that made for, oh, I dare say fifty',
    'years.\' He peered at Winston over the top',
    'of his spectacles. \'Is there anything special',
    'I can do for you? Or did you just want to',
    'look round?\' \'I was passing,\' said Winston',
    'vaguely. \'I just looked in. I don\'t want',
    'anything in particular.\' \'It\'s just as well,\'',
    'said the other, \'because I don\'t suppose',
    'I could have satisfied you.\' He made an apologetic',
    'gesture with his softpalmed hand. \'You see',
    'how it is; an empty shop, you might say.',
    'Between you and me, the antique trade\'s just',
    'about finished. No demand any longer, and',
    'no stock either. Furniture, china, glass',
    'it\'s all been broken up by degrees. And of',
    'course the metal stuff\'s mostly been melted',
    'down. I haven\'t seen a brass candlestick',
    'in years.\' The tiny interior of the shop',
    'was in fact uncomfortably full, but there',
    'was almost nothing in it of the slightest',
    'value. The floorspace was very restricted,',
    'because all round the walls were stacked',
    'innumerable dusty picture-frames. In the',
    'window there were trays of nuts and bolts,',
    'worn-out chisels, penknives with broken blades,',
    'tarnished watches that did not even pretend',
    'to be in going order, and other miscellaneous',
    'rubbish. Only on a small table in the corner',
    'was there a litter of odds and ends, lacquered',
    'snuffboxes, agate brooches, and the like,',
    'which looked as though they might include',
    'something interesting. As Winston wandered',
    'towards the table his eye was caught by a',
    'round, smooth thing that gleamed softly in',
    'the lamplight, and he picked it up. It was',
    'a heavy lump of glass, curved on one side,',
    'flat on the other, making almost a hemisphere.',
    'There was a peculiar softness, as of rainwater,',
    'in both the colour and the texture of the',
    'glass. At the heart of it, magnified by the',
    'curved surface, there was a strange, pink,',
    'convoluted object that recalled a rose or',
    'a sea anemone. \'What is it?\' said Winston,',
    'fascinated. \'That\'s coral, that is,\' said',
    'the old man. \'It must have come from the',
    'Indian Ocean. They used to kind of embed',
    'it in the glass. That wasn\'t made less than',
    'a hundred years ago. More, by the look of',
    'it.\' \'It\'s a beautiful thing,\' said Winston.',
    '\'It is a beautiful thing,\' said the other',
    'appreciatively. \'But there\'s not many that\'d',
    'say so nowadays.\' He coughed. \'Now, if it',
    'so happened that you wanted to buy it, that\'d',
    'cost you four dollars. I can remember when',
    'a thing like that would have fetched eight',
    'pounds, and eight pounds was, well, I can\'t',
    'work it out, but it was a lot of money. But',
    'who cares about genuine antiques nowadays,',
    'even the few that\'s left?\' Winston immediately',
    'paid over the four dollars and slid the coveted',
    'thing into his pocket. What appealed to him',
    'about it was not so much its beauty as the',
    'air it seemed to possess of belonging to',
    'an age quite different from the present one.',
    'The soft, rainwatery glass was not like any',
    'glass that he had ever seen. The thing was',
    'doubly attractive because of its apparent',
    'uselessness, though he could guess that it',
    'must once have been intended as a paperweight.',
    'It was very heavy in his pocket, but fortunately',
    'it did not make much of a bulge. It was a',
    'queer thing, even a compromising thing, for',
    'a Party member to have in his possession.',
    'Anything old, and for that matter anything',
    'beautiful, was always vaguely suspect. The',
    'old man had grown noticeably more cheerful',
    'after receiving the four dollars. Winston',
    'realized that he would have accepted three',
    'or even two. \'There\'s another room upstairs',
    'that you might care to take a look at,\' he',
    'said. \'There\'s not much in it. Just a few',
    'pieces. We\'ll do with a light if we\'re going',
    'upstairs.\' He lit another lamp, and, with',
    'bowed back, led the way slowly up the steep',
    'and worn stairs and along a tiny passage,',
    'into a room which did not give on the street',
    'but looked out on a cobbled yard and a forest',
    'of chimney-pots. Winston noticed that the',
    'furniture was still arranged as though the',
    'room were meant to be lived in. There was',
    'a strip of carpet on the floor, a picture',
    'or two on the walls, and a deep, slatternly',
    'arm-chair drawn up to the fireplace. An old-fashioned',
    'glass clock with a twelve-hour face was ticking',
    'away on the mantelpiece. Under the window,',
    'and occupying nearly a quarter of the room,',
    'was an enormous bed with the mattress still',
    'on it. \'We lived here till my wife died,\'',
    'said the old man half apologetically. \'I\'m',
    'selling the furniture off by little and little.',
    'Now that\'s a beautiful mahogany bed, or at',
    'least it would be if you could get the bugs',
    'out of it. But I dare say you\'d find it a',
    'little bit cumbersome.\' He was holding the',
    'lamp high up, so as to illuminate the whole',
    'room, and in the warm dim light the place',
    'looked curiously inviting. The thought flitted',
    'through Winston\'s mind that it would probably',
    'be quite easy to rent the room for a few',
    'dollars a week, if he dared to take the risk.',
    'It was a wild, impossible notion, to be abandoned',
    'as soon as thought of; but the room had awakened',
    'in him a sort of nostalgia, a sort of ancestral',
    'memory. It seemed to him that he knew exactly',
    'what it felt like to sit in a room like this,',
    'in an arm-chair beside an open fire with',
    'your feet in the fender and a kettle on the',
    'hob; utterly alone, utterly secure, with',
    'nobody watching you, no voice pursuing you,',
    'no sound except the singing of the kettle',
    'and the friendly ticking of the clock. \'There\'s',
    'no telescreen!\' he could not help murmuring.',
    '\'Ah,\' said the old man, \'I never had one',
    'of those things. Too expensive. And I never',
    'seemed to feel the need of it, somehow. Now',
    'that\'s a nice gateleg table in the corner',
    'there. Though of course you\'d have to put',
    'new hinges on it if you wanted to use the',
    'flaps.\' There was a small bookcase in the',
    'other corner, and Winston had already gravitated',
    'towards it. It contained nothing but rubbish.',
    'The hunting-down and destruction of books',
    'had been done with the same thoroughness',
    'in the prole quarters as everywhere else.',
    'It was very unlikely that there existed anywhere',
    'in Oceania a copy of a book printed earlier',
    'than 1960. The old man, still carrying the',
    'lamp, was standing in front of a picture',
    'in a rosewood frame which hung on the other',
    'side of the fireplace, opposite the bed.',
    '\'Now, if you happen to be interested in old',
    'prints at all, , \' he began delicately. Winston',
    'came across to examine the picture. It was',
    'a steel engraving of an oval building with',
    'rectangular windows, and a small tower in',
    'front. There was a railing running round',
    'the building, and at the rear end there was',
    'what appeared to be a statue. Winston gazed',
    'at it for some moments. It seemed vaguely',
    'familiar, though he did not remember the',
    'statue. \'The frame\'s fixed to the wall,\'',
    'said the old man, \'but I could unscrew it',
    'for you, I dare say.\' \'I know that building,\'',
    'said Winston finally. \'It\'s a ruin now. It\'s',
    'in the middle of the street outside the Palace',
    'of Justice.\' \'That\'s right. Outside the Law',
    'Courts. It was bombed in, oh, many years',
    'ago. It was a church at one time, St Clement',
    'Danes, its name was.\' He smiled apologetically,',
    'as though conscious of saying something slightly',
    'ridiculous, and added: \'Oranges and lemons,',
    'say the bells of St Clement\'s!\' \'What\'s that?\'',
    'said Winston. \'Oh, "Oranges and lemons, say',
    'the bells of St Clement\'s." That was a rhyme',
    'we had when I was a little boy. How it goes',
    'on I don\'t remember, but I do know it ended',
    'up, "Here comes a candle to light you to',
    'bed, Here comes a chopper to chop off your',
    'head." It was a kind of a dance. They held',
    'out their arms for you to pass under, and',
    'when they came to "Here comes a chopper to',
    'chop off your head" they brought their arms',
    'down and caught you. It was just names of',
    'churches. All the London churches were in',
    'it, all the principal ones, that is.\' Winston',
    'wondered vaguely to what century the church',
    'belonged. It was always difficult to determine',
    'the age of a London building. Anything large',
    'and impressive, if it was reasonably new',
    'in appearance, was automatically claimed',
    'as having been built since the Revolution,',
    'while anything that was obviously of earlier',
    'date was ascribed to some dim period called',
    'the Middle Ages. The centuries of capitalism',
    'were held to have produced nothing of any',
    'value. One could not learn history from architecture',
    'any more than one could learn it from books.',
    'Statues, inscriptions, memorial stones, the',
    'names of streets, anything that might throw',
    'light upon the past had been systematically',
    'altered. \'I never knew it had been a church,\'',
    'he said. \'There\'s a lot of them left, really,\'',
    'said the old man, \'though they\'ve been put',
    'to other uses. Now, how did that rhyme go?',
    'Ah! I\'ve got it! "Oranges and lemons, say',
    'the bells of St Clement\'s, You owe me three',
    'farthings, say the bells of St Martin\'s,',
    ', " there, now, that\'s as far as I can get.',
    'A farthing, that was a small copper coin,',
    'looked something like a cent.\' \'Where was',
    'St Martin\'s?\' said Winston. \'St Martin\'s?',
    'That\'s still standing. It\'s in Victory Square,',
    'alongside the picture gallery. A building',
    'with a kind of a triangular porch and pillars',
    'in front, and a big flight of steps.\' Winston',
    'knew the place well. It was a museum used',
    'for propaganda displays of various kinds,',
    'scale models of rocket bombs and Floating',
    'Fortresses, waxwork tableaux illustrating',
    'enemy atrocities, and the like. \'St Martin\'s-in-the-Fields',
    'it used to be called,\' supplemented the old',
    'man, \'though I don\'t recollect any fields',
    'anywhere in those parts.\' Winston did not',
    'buy the picture. It would have been an even',
    'more incongruous possession than the glass',
    'paperweight, and impossible to carry home,',
    'unless it were taken out of its frame. But',
    'he lingered for some minutes more, talking',
    'to the old man, whose name, he discovered,',
    'was not Weeks, as one might have gathered',
    'from the inscription over the shop-front,',
    'but Charrington. Mr Charrington, it seemed,',
    'was a widower aged sixty-three and had inhabited',
    'this shop for thirty years. Throughout that',
    'time he had been intending to alter the name',
    'over the window, but had never quite got',
    'to the point of doing it. All the while that',
    'they were talking the half-remembered rhyme',
    'kept running through Winston\'s head. Oranges',
    'and lemons say the bells of St Clement\'s,',
    'You owe me three farthings, say the bells',
    'of St Martin\'s! It was curious, but when',
    'you said it to yourself you had the illusion',
    'of actually hearing bells, the bells of a',
    'lost London that still existed somewhere',
    'or other, disguised and forgotten. From one',
    'ghostly steeple after another he seemed to',
    'hear them pealing forth. Yet so far as he',
    'could remember he had never in real life',
    'heard church bells ringing. He got away from',
    'Mr Charrington and went down the stairs alone,',
    'so as not to let the old man see him reconnoitring',
    'the street before stepping out of the door.',
    'He had already made up his mind that after',
    'a suitable interval, a month, say, he would',
    'take the risk of visiting the shop again.',
    'It was perhaps not more dangerous than shirking',
    'an evening at the Centre. The serious piece',
    'of folly had been to come back here in the',
    'first place, after buying the diary and without',
    'knowing whether the proprietor of the shop',
    'could be trusted. However, , ! Yes, he thought',
    'again, he would come back. He would buy further',
    'scraps of beautiful rubbish. He would buy',
    'the engraving of St Clement Danes, take it',
    'out of its frame, and carry it home concealed',
    'under the jacket of his overalls. He would',
    'drag the rest of that poem out of Mr Charrington\'s',
    'memory. Even the lunatic project of renting',
    'the room upstairs flashed momentarily through',
    'his mind again. For perhaps five seconds',
    'exaltation made him careless, and he stepped',
    'out on to the pavement without so much as',
    'a preliminary glance through the window.',
    'He had even started humming to an improvised',
    'tune Oranges and lemons, say the bells of',
    'St Clement\'s, You owe me three farthings,',
    'say the, ,  Suddenly his heart seemed to',
    'turn to ice and his bowels to water. A figure',
    'in blue overalls was coming down the pavement,',
    'not ten metres away. It was the girl from',
    'the Fiction Department, the girl with dark',
    'hair. The light was failing, but there was',
    'no difficulty in recognizing her. She looked',
    'him straight in the face, then walked quickly',
    'on as though she had not seen him. For a',
    'few seconds Winston was too paralysed to',
    'move. Then he turned to the right and walked',
    'heavily away, not noticing for the moment',
    'that he was going in the wrong direction.',
    'At any rate, one question was settled. There',
    'was no doubting any longer that the girl',
    'was spying on him. She must have followed',
    'him here, because it was not credible that',
    'by pure chance she should have happened to',
    'be walking on the same evening up the same',
    'obscure backstreet, kilometres distant from',
    'any quarter where Party members lived. It',
    'was too great a coincidence. Whether she',
    'was really an agent of the Thought Police,',
    'or simply an amateur spy actuated by officiousness,',
    'hardly mattered. It was enough that she was',
    'watching him. Probably she had seen him go',
    'into the pub as well. It was an effort to',
    'walk. The lump of glass in his pocket banged',
    'against his thigh at each step, and he was',
    'half minded to take it out and throw it away.',
    'The worst thing was the pain in his belly.',
    'For a couple of minutes he had the feeling',
    'that he would die if he did not reach a lavatory',
    'soon. But there would be no public lavatories',
    'in a quarter like this. Then the spasm passed,',
    'leaving a dull ache behind. The street was',
    'a blind alley. Winston halted, stood for',
    'several seconds wondering vaguely what to',
    'do, then turned round and began to retrace',
    'his steps. As he turned it occurred to him',
    'that the girl had only passed him three minutes',
    'ago and that by running he could probably',
    'catch up with her. He could keep on her track',
    'till they were in some quiet place, and then',
    'smash her skull in with a cobblestone. The',
    'piece of glass in his pocket would be heavy',
    'enough for the job. But he abandoned the',
    'idea immediately, because even the thought',
    'of making any physical effort was unbearable.',
    'He could not run, he could not strike a blow.',
    'Besides, she was young and lusty and would',
    'defend herself. He thought also of hurrying',
    'to the Community Centre and staying there',
    'till the place closed, so as to establish',
    'a partial alibi for the evening. But that',
    'too was impossible. A deadly lassitude had',
    'taken hold of him. All he wanted was to get',
    'home quickly and then sit down and be quiet.',
    'It was after twenty-two hours when he got',
    'back to the flat. The lights would be switched',
    'off at the main at twenty-three thirty. He',
    'went into the kitchen and swallowed nearly',
    'a teacupful of Victory Gin. Then he went',
    'to the table in the alcove, sat down, and',
    'took the diary out of the drawer. But he',
    'did not open it at once. From the telescreen',
    'a brassy female voice was squalling a patriotic',
    'song. He sat staring at the marbled cover',
    'of the book, trying without success to shut',
    'the voice out of his consciousness. It was',
    'at night that they came for you, always at',
    'night. The proper thing was to kill yourself',
    'before they got you. Undoubtedly some people',
    'did so. Many of the disappearances were actually',
    'suicides. But it needed desperate courage',
    'to kill yourself in a world where firearms,',
    'or any quick and certain poison, were completely',
    'unprocurable. He thought with a kind of astonishment',
    'of the biological uselessness of pain and',
    'fear, the treachery of the human body which',
    'always freezes into inertia at exactly the',
    'moment when a special effort is needed. He',
    'might have silenced the dark-haired girl',
    'if only he had acted quickly enough: but',
    'precisely because of the extremity of his',
    'danger he had lost the power to act. It struck',
    'him that in moments of crisis one is never',
    'fighting against an external enemy, but always',
    'against one\'s own body. Even now, in spite',
    'of the gin, the dull ache in his belly made',
    'consecutive thought impossible. And it is',
    'the same, he perceived, in all seemingly',
    'heroic or tragic situations. On the battlefield,',
    'in the torture chamber, on a sinking ship,',
    'the issues that you are fighting for are',
    'always forgotten, because the body swells',
    'up until it fills the universe, and even',
    'when you are not paralysed by fright or screaming',
    'with pain, life is a moment-to-moment struggle',
    'against hunger or cold or sleeplessness,',
    'against a sour stomach or an aching tooth.',
    'He opened the diary. It was important to',
    'write something down. The woman on the telescreen',
    'had started a new song. Her voice seemed',
    'to stick into his brain like jagged splinters',
    'of glass. He tried to think of O\'Brien, for',
    'whom, or to whom, the diary was written,',
    'but instead he began thinking of the things',
    'that would happen to him after the Thought',
    'Police took him away. It would not matter',
    'if they killed you at once. To be killed',
    'was what you expected. But before death (nobody',
    'spoke of such things, yet everybody knew',
    'of them) there was the routine of confession',
    'that had to be gone through: the grovelling',
    'on the floor and screaming for mercy, the',
    'crack of broken bones, the smashed teeth',
    'and bloody clots of hair. Why did you have',
    'to endure it, since the end was always the',
    'same? Why was it not possible to cut a few',
    'days or weeks out of your life? Nobody ever',
    'escaped detection, and nobody ever failed',
    'to confess. When once you had succumbed to',
    'thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given',
    'date you would be dead. Why then did that',
    'horror, which altered nothing, have to lie',
    'embedded in future time? He tried with a',
    'little more success than before to summon',
    'up the image of O\'Brien. \'We shall meet in',
    'the place where there is no darkness,\' O\'Brien',
    'had said to him. He knew what it meant, or',
    'thought he knew. The place where there is',
    'no darkness was the imagined future, which',
    'one would never see, but which, by foreknowledge,',
    'one could mystically share in. But with the',
    'voice from the telescreen nagging at his',
    'ears he could not follow the train of thought',
    'further. He put a cigarette in his mouth.',
    'Half the tobacco promptly fell out on to',
    'his tongue, a bitter dust which was difficult',
    'to spit out again. The face of Big Brother',
    'swam into his mind, displacing that of O\'Brien.',
    'Just as he had done a few days earlier, he',
    'slid a coin out of his pocket and looked',
    'at it. The face gazed up at him, heavy, calm,',
    'protecting: but what kind of smile was hidden',
    'beneath the dark moustache? Like a leaden',
    'knell the words came back at him: WAR IS',
    'PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH',
    'PART TWO Chapter 1 It was the middle of the',
    'morning, and Winston had left the cubicle',
    'to go to the lavatory. A solitary figure',
    'was coming towards him from the other end',
    'of the long, brightly-lit corridor. It was',
    'the girl with dark hair. Four days had gone',
    'past since the evening when he had run into',
    'her outside the junk-shop. As she came nearer',
    'he saw that her right arm was in a sling,',
    'not noticeable at a distance because it was',
    'of the same colour as her overalls. Probably',
    'she had crushed her hand while swinging round',
    'one of the big kaleidoscopes on which the',
    'plots of novels were \'roughed in\'. It was',
    'a common accident in the Fiction Department.',
    'They were perhaps four metres apart when',
    'the girl stumbled and fell almost flat on',
    'her face. A sharp cry of pain was wrung out',
    'of her. She must have fallen right on the',
    'injured arm. Winston stopped short. The girl',
    'had risen to her knees. Her face had turned',
    'a milky yellow colour against which her mouth',
    'stood out redder than ever. Her eyes were',
    'fixed on his, with an appealing expression',
    'that looked more like fear than pain. A curious',
    'emotion stirred in Winston\'s heart. In front',
    'of him was an enemy who was trying to kill',
    'him: in front of him, also, was a human creature,',
    'in pain and perhaps with a broken bone. Already',
    'he had instinctively started forward to help',
    'her. In the moment when he had seen her fall',
    'on the bandaged arm, it had been as though',
    'he felt the pain in his own body. \'You\'re',
    'hurt?\' he said. \'It\'s nothing. My arm. It\'ll',
    'be all right in a second.\' She spoke as though',
    'her heart were fluttering. She had certainly',
    'turned very pale. \'You haven\'t broken anything?\'',
    '\'No, I\'m all right. It hurt for a moment,',
    'that\'s all.\' She held out her free hand to',
    'him, and he helped her up. She had regained',
    'some of her colour, and appeared very much',
    'better. \'It\'s nothing,\' she repeated shortly.',
    '\'I only gave my wrist a bit of a bang. Thanks,',
    'comrade!\' And with that she walked on in',
    'the direction in which she had been going,',
    'as briskly as though it had really been nothing.',
    'The whole incident could not have taken as',
    'much as half a minute. Not to let one\'s feelings',
    'appear in one\'s face was a habit that had',
    'acquired the status of an instinct, and in',
    'any case they had been standing straight',
    'in front of a telescreen when the thing happened.',
    'Nevertheless it had been very difficult not',
    'to betray a momentary surprise, for in the',
    'two or three seconds while he was helping',
    'her up the girl had slipped something into',
    'his hand. There was no question that she',
    'had done it intentionally. It was something',
    'small and flat. As he passed through the',
    'lavatory door he transferred it to his pocket',
    'and felt it with the tips of his fingers.',
    'It was a scrap of paper folded into a square.',
    'While he stood at the urinal he managed,',
    'with a little more fingering, to get it unfolded.',
    'Obviously there must be a message of some',
    'kind written on it. For a moment he was tempted',
    'to take it into one of the water-closets',
    'and read it at once. But that would be shocking',
    'folly, as he well knew. There was no place',
    'where you could be more certain that the',
    'telescreens were watched continuously. He',
    'went back to his cubicle, sat down, threw',
    'the fragment of paper casually among the',
    'other papers on the desk, put on his spectacles',
    'and hitched the speakwrite towards him. \'Five',
    'minutes,\' he told himself, \'five minutes',
    'at the very least!\' His heart bumped in his',
    'breast with frightening loudness. Fortunately',
    'the piece of work he was engaged on was mere',
    'routine, the rectification of a long list',
    'of figures, not needing close attention.',
    'Whatever was written on the paper, it must',
    'have some kind of political meaning. So far',
    'as he could see there were two possibilities.',
    'One, much the more likely, was that the girl',
    'was an agent of the Thought Police, just',
    'as he had feared. He did not know why the',
    'Thought Police should choose to deliver their',
    'messages in such a fashion, but perhaps they',
    'had their reasons. The thing that was written',
    'on the paper might be a threat, a summons,',
    'an order to commit suicide, a trap of some',
    'description. But there was another, wilder',
    'possibility that kept raising its head, though',
    'he tried vainly to suppress it. This was,',
    'that the message did not come from the Thought',
    'Police at all, but from some kind of underground',
    'organization. Perhaps the Brotherhood existed',
    'after all! Perhaps the girl was part of it!',
    'No doubt the idea was absurd, but it had',
    'sprung into his mind in the very instant',
    'of feeling the scrap of paper in his hand.',
    'It was not till a couple of minutes later',
    'that the other, more probable explanation',
    'had occurred to him. And even now, though',
    'his intellect told him that the message probably',
    'meant death, still, that was not what he',
    'believed, and the unreasonable hope persisted,',
    'and his heart banged, and it was with difficulty',
    'that he kept his voice from trembling as',
    'he murmured his figures into the speakwrite.',
    'He rolled up the completed bundle of work',
    'and slid it into the pneumatic tube. Eight',
    'minutes had gone by. He re-adjusted his spectacles',
    'on his nose, sighed, and drew the next batch',
    'of work towards him, with the scrap of paper',
    'on top of it. He flattened it out. On it',
    'was written, in a large unformed handwriting:',
    'I LOVE YOU. For several seconds he was too',
    'stunned even to throw the incriminating thing',
    'into the memory hole. When he did so, although',
    'he knew very well the danger of showing too',
    'much interest, he could not resist reading',
    'it once again, just to make sure that the',
    'words were really there. For the rest of',
    'the morning it was very difficult to work.',
    'What was even worse than having to focus',
    'his mind on a series of niggling jobs was',
    'the need to conceal his agitation from the',
    'telescreen. He felt as though a fire were',
    'burning in his belly. Lunch in the hot, crowded,',
    'noise-filled canteen was torment. He had',
    'hoped to be alone for a little while during',
    'the lunch hour, but as bad luck would have',
    'it the imbecile Parsons flopped down beside',
    'him, the tang of his sweat almost defeating',
    'the tinny smell of stew, and kept up a stream',
    'of talk about the preparations for Hate Week.',
    'He was particularly enthusiastic about a',
    'papier-mache model of Big Brother\'s head,',
    'two metres wide, which was being made for',
    'the occasion by his daughter\'s troop of Spies.',
    'The irritating thing was that in the racket',
    'of voices Winston could hardly hear what',
    'Parsons was saying, and was constantly having',
    'to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated.',
    'Just once he caught a glimpse of the girl,',
    'at a table with two other girls at the far',
    'end of the room. She appeared not to have',
    'seen him, and he did not look in that direction',
    'again. The afternoon was more bearable. Immediately',
    'after lunch there arrived a delicate, difficult',
    'piece of work which would take several hours',
    'and necessitated putting everything else',
    'aside. It consisted in falsifying a series',
    'of production reports of two years ago, in',
    'such a way as to cast discredit on a prominent',
    'member of the Inner Party, who was now under',
    'a cloud. This was the kind of thing that',
    'Winston was good at, and for more than two',
    'hours he succeeded in shutting the girl out',
    'of his mind altogether. Then the memory of',
    'her face came back, and with it a raging,',
    'intolerable desire to be alone. Until he',
    'could be alone it was impossible to think',
    'this new development out. Tonight was one',
    'of his nights at the Community Centre. He',
    'wolfed another tasteless meal in the canteen,',
    'hurried off to the Centre, took part in the',
    'solemn foolery of a \'discussion group\', played',
    'two games of table tennis, swallowed several',
    'glasses of gin, and sat for half an hour',
    'through a lecture entitled \'Ingsoc in relation',
    'to chess\'. His soul writhed with boredom,',
    'but for once he had had no impulse to shirk',
    'his evening at the Centre. At the sight of',
    'the words I LOVE YOU the desire to stay alive',
    'had welled up in him, and the taking of minor',
    'risks suddenly seemed stupid. It was not',
    'till twenty-three hours, when he was home',
    'and in bed, in the darkness, where you were',
    'safe even from the telescreen so long as',
    'you kept silent, that he was able to think',
    'continuously. It was a physical problem that',
    'had to be solved: how to get in touch with',
    'the girl and arrange a meeting. He did not',
    'consider any longer the possibility that',
    'she might be laying some kind of trap for',
    'him. He knew that it was not so, because',
    'of her unmistakable agitation when she handed',
    'him the note. Obviously she had been frightened',
    'out of her wits, as well she might be. Nor',
    'did the idea of refusing her advances even',
    'cross his mind. Only five nights ago he had',
    'contemplated smashing her skull in with a',
    'cobblestone, but that was of no importance.',
    'He thought of her naked, youthful body, as',
    'he had seen it in his dream. He had imagined',
    'her a fool like all the rest of them, her',
    'head stuffed with lies and hatred, her belly',
    'full of ice. A kind of fever seized him at',
    'the thought that he might lose her, the white',
    'youthful body might slip away from him! What',
    'he feared more than anything else was that',
    'she would simply change her mind if he did',
    'not get in touch with her quickly. But the',
    'physical difficulty of meeting was enormous.',
    'It was like trying to make a move at chess',
    'when you were already mated. Whichever way',
    'you turned, the telescreen faced you. Actually,',
    'all the possible ways of communicating with',
    'her had occurred to him within five minutes',
    'of reading the note; but now, with time to',
    'think, he went over them one by one, as though',
    'laying out a row of instruments on a table.',
    'Obviously the kind of encounter that had',
    'happened this morning could not be repeated.',
    'If she had worked in the Records Department',
    'it might have been comparatively simple,',
    'but he had only a very dim idea whereabouts',
    'in the building the Fiction Department lay,',
    'and he had no pretext for going there. If',
    'he had known where she lived, and at what',
    'time she left work, he could have contrived',
    'to meet her somewhere on her way home; but',
    'to try to follow her home was not safe, because',
    'it would mean loitering about outside the',
    'Ministry, which was bound to be noticed.',
    'As for sending a letter through the mails,',
    'it was out of the question. By a routine',
    'that was not even secret, all letters were',
    'opened in transit. Actually, few people ever',
    'wrote letters. For the messages that it was',
    'occasionally necessary to send, there were',
    'printed postcards with long lists of phrases,',
    'and you struck out the ones that were inapplicable.',
    'In any case he did not know the girl\'s name,',
    'let alone her address. Finally he decided',
    'that the safest place was the canteen. If',
    'he could get her at a table by herself, somewhere',
    'in the middle of the room, not too near the',
    'telescreens, and with a sufficient buzz of',
    'conversation all round, if these conditions',
    'endured for, say, thirty seconds, it might',
    'be possible to exchange a few words. For',
    'a week after this, life was like a restless',
    'dream. On the next day she did not appear',
    'in the canteen until he was leaving it, the',
    'whistle having already blown. Presumably',
    'she had been changed on to a later shift.',
    'They passed each other without a glance.',
    'On the day after that she was in the canteen',
    'at the usual time, but with three other girls',
    'and immediately under a telescreen. Then',
    'for three dreadful days she did not appear',
    'at all. His whole mind and body seemed to',
    'be afflicted with an unbearable sensitivity,',
    'a sort of transparency, which made every',
    'movement, every sound, every contact, every',
    'word that he had to speak or listen to, an',
    'agony. Even in sleep he could not altogether',
    'escape from her image. He did not touch the',
    'diary during those days. If there was any',
    'relief, it was in his work, in which he could',
    'sometimes forget himself for ten minutes',
    'at a stretch. He had absolutely no clue as',
    'to what had happened to her. There was no',
    'enquiry he could make. She might have been',
    'vaporized, she might have committed suicide,',
    'she might have been transferred to the other',
    'end of Oceania: worst and likeliest of all,',
    'she might simply have changed her mind and',
    'decided to avoid him. The next day she reappeared.',
    'Her arm was out of the sling and she had',
    'a band of sticking-plaster round her wrist.',
    'The relief of seeing her was so great that',
    'he could not resist staring directly at her',
    'for several seconds. On the following day',
    'he very nearly succeeded in speaking to her.',
    'When he came into the canteen she was sitting',
    'at a table well out from the wall, and was',
    'quite alone. It was early, and the place',
    'was not very full. The queue edged forward',
    'till Winston was almost at the counter, then',
    'was held up for two minutes because someone',
    'in front was complaining that he had not',
    'received his tablet of saccharine. But the',
    'girl was still alone when Winston secured',
    'his tray and began to make for her table.',
    'He walked casually towards her, his eyes',
    'searching for a place at some table beyond',
    'her. She was perhaps three metres away from',
    'him. Another two seconds would do it. Then',
    'a voice behind him called, \'Smith!\' He pretended',
    'not to hear. \'Smith!\' repeated the voice,',
    'more loudly. It was no use. He turned round.',
    'A blond-headed, silly-faced young man named',
    'Wilsher, whom he barely knew, was inviting',
    'him with a smile to a vacant place at his',
    'table. It was not safe to refuse. After having',
    'been recognized, he could not go and sit',
    'at a table with an unattended girl. It was',
    'too noticeable. He sat down with a friendly',
    'smile. The silly blond face beamed into his.',
    'Winston had a hallucination of himself smashing',
    'a pick-axe right into the middle of it. The',
    'girl\'s table filled up a few minutes later.',
    'But she must have seen him coming towards',
    'her, and perhaps she would take the hint.',
    'Next day he took care to arrive early. Surely',
    'enough, she was at a table in about the same',
    'place, and again alone. The person immediately',
    'ahead of him in the queue was a small, swiftly-moving,',
    'beetle-like man with a flat face and tiny,',
    'suspicious eyes. As Winston turned away from',
    'the counter with his tray, he saw that the',
    'little man was making straight for the girl\'s',
    'table. His hopes sank again. There was a',
    'vacant place at a table further away, but',
    'something in the little man\'s appearance',
    'suggested that he would be sufficiently attentive',
    'to his own comfort to choose the emptiest',
    'table. With ice at his heart Winston followed.',
    'It was no use unless he could get the girl',
    'alone. At this moment there was a tremendous',
    'crash. The little man was sprawling on all',
    'fours, his tray had gone flying, two streams',
    'of soup and coffee were flowing across the',
    'floor. He started to his feet with a malignant',
    'glance at Winston, whom he evidently suspected',
    'of having tripped him up. But it was all',
    'right. Five seconds later, with a thundering',
    'heart, Winston was sitting at the girl\'s',
    'table. He did not look at her. He unpacked',
    'his tray and promptly began eating. It was',
    'all-important to speak at once, before anyone',
    'else came, but now a terrible fear had taken',
    'possession of him. A week had gone by since',
    'she had first approached him. She would have',
    'changed her mind, she must have changed her',
    'mind! It was impossible that this affair',
    'should end successfully; such things did',
    'not happen in real life. He might have flinched',
    'altogether from speaking if at this moment',
    'he had not seen Ampleforth, the hairy-eared',
    'poet, wandering limply round the room with',
    'a tray, looking for a place to sit down.',
    'In his vague way Ampleforth was attached',
    'to Winston, and would certainly sit down',
    'at his table if he caught sight of him. There',
    'was perhaps a minute in which to act. Both',
    'Winston and the girl were eating steadily.',
    'The stuff they were eating was a thin stew,',
    'actually a soup, of haricot beans. In a low',
    'murmur Winston began speaking. Neither of',
    'them looked up; steadily they spooned the',
    'watery stuff into their mouths, and between',
    'spoonfuls exchanged the few necessary words',
    'in low expressionless voices. \'What time',
    'do you leave work?\' \'Eighteen-thirty.\' \'Where',
    'can we meet?\' \'Victory Square, near the monument.\'',
    '\'It\'s full of telescreens.\' \'It doesn\'t matter',
    'if there\'s a crowd.\' \'Any signal?\' \'No. Don\'t',
    'come up to me until you see me among a lot',
    'of people. And don\'t look at me. Just keep',
    'somewhere near me.\' \'What time?\' \'Nineteen',
    'hours.\' \'All right.\' Ampleforth failed to',
    'see Winston and sat down at another table.',
    'They did not speak again, and, so far as',
    'it was possible for two people sitting on',
    'opposite sides of the same table, they did',
    'not look at one another. The girl finished',
    'her lunch quickly and made off, while Winston',
    'stayed to smoke a cigarette. Winston was',
    'in Victory Square before the appointed time.',
    'He wandered round the base of the enormous',
    'fluted column, at the top of which Big Brother\'s',
    'statue gazed southward towards the skies',
    'where he had vanquished the Eurasian aeroplanes',
    '(the Eastasian aeroplanes, it had been, a',
    'few years ago) in the Battle of Airstrip',
    'One. In the street in front of it there was',
    'a statue of a man on horseback which was',
    'supposed to represent Oliver Cromwell. At',
    'five minutes past the hour the girl had still',
    'not appeared. Again the terrible fear seized',
    'upon Winston. She was not coming, she had',
    'changed her mind! He walked slowly up to',
    'the north side of the square and got a sort',
    'of pale-coloured pleasure from identifying',
    'St Martin\'s Church, whose bells, when it',
    'had bells, had chimed \'You owe me three farthings.\'',
    'Then he saw the girl standing at the base',
    'of the monument, reading or pretending to',
    'read a poster which ran spirally up the column.',
    'It was not safe to go near her until some',
    'more people had accumulated. There were telescreens',
    'all round the pediment. But at this moment',
    'there was a din of shouting and a zoom of',
    'heavy vehicles from somewhere to the left.',
    'Suddenly everyone seemed to be running across',
    'the square. The girl nipped nimbly round',
    'the lions at the base of the monument and',
    'joined in the rush. Winston followed. As',
    'he ran, he gathered from some shouted remarks',
    'that a convoy of Eurasian prisoners was passing.',
    'Already a dense mass of people was blocking',
    'the south side of the square. Winston, at',
    'normal times the kind of person who gravitates',
    'to the outer edge of any kind of scrimmage,',
    'shoved, butted, squirmed his way forward',
    'into the heart of the crowd. Soon he was',
    'within arm\'s length of the girl, but the',
    'way was blocked by an enormous prole and',
    'an almost equally enormous woman, presumably',
    'his wife, who seemed to form an impenetrable',
    'wall of flesh. Winston wriggled himself sideways,',
    'and with a violent lunge managed to drive',
    'his shoulder between them. For a moment it',
    'felt as though his entrails were being ground',
    'to pulp between the two muscular hips, then',
    'he had broken through, sweating a little.',
    'He was next to the girl. They were shoulder',
    'to shoulder, both staring fixedly in front',
    'of them. A long line of trucks, with wooden-faced',
    'guards armed with sub-machine guns standing',
    'upright in each corner, was passing slowly',
    'down the street. In the trucks little yellow',
    'men in shabby greenish uniforms were squatting,',
    'jammed close together. Their sad, Mongolian',
    'faces gazed out over the sides of the trucks',
    'utterly incurious. Occasionally when a truck',
    'jolted there was a clank-clank of metal:',
    'all the prisoners were wearing leg-irons.',
    'Truck-load after truck-load of the sad faces',
    'passed. Winston knew they were there but',
    'he saw them only intermittently. The girl\'s',
    'shoulder, and her arm right down to the elbow,',
    'were pressed against his. Her cheek was almost',
    'near enough for him to feel its warmth. She',
    'had immediately taken charge of the situation,',
    'just as she had done in the canteen. She',
    'began speaking in the same expressionless',
    'voice as before, with lips barely moving,',
    'a mere murmur easily drowned by the din of',
    'voices and the rumbling of the trucks. \'Can',
    'you hear me?\' \'Yes.\' \'Can you get Sunday',
    'afternoon off?\' \'Yes.\' \'Then listen carefully.',
    'You\'ll have to remember this. Go to Paddington',
    'Station, , \' With a sort of military precision',
    'that astonished him, she outlined the route',
    'that he was to follow. A half-hour railway',
    'journey; turn left outside the station; two',
    'kilometres along the road; a gate with the',
    'top bar missing; a path across a field; a',
    'grass-grown lane; a track between bushes;',
    'a dead tree with moss on it. It was as though',
    'she had a map inside her head. \'Can you remember',
    'all that?\' she murmured finally. \'Yes.\' \'You',
    'turn left, then right, then left again. And',
    'the gate\'s got no top bar.\' \'Yes. What time?\'',
    '\'About fifteen. You may have to wait. I\'ll',
    'get there by another way. Are you sure you',
    'remember everything?\' \'Yes.\' \'Then get away',
    'from me as quick as you can.\' She need not',
    'have told him that. But for the moment they',
    'could not extricate themselves from the crowd.',
    'The trucks were still filing past, the people',
    'still insatiably gaping. At the start there',
    'had been a few boos and hisses, but it came',
    'only from the Party members among the crowd,',
    'and had soon stopped. The prevailing emotion',
    'was simply curiosity. Foreigners, whether',
    'from Eurasia or from Eastasia, were a kind',
    'of strange animal. One literally never saw',
    'them except in the guise of prisoners, and',
    'even as prisoners one never got more than',
    'a momentary glimpse of them. Nor did one',
    'know what became of them, apart from the',
    'few who were hanged as war-criminals: the',
    'others simply vanished, presumably into forced-labour',
    'camps. The round Mogol faces had given way',
    'to faces of a more European type, dirty,',
    'bearded and exhausted. From over scrubby',
    'cheekbones eyes looked into Winston\'s, sometimes',
    'with strange intensity, and flashed away',
    'again. The convoy was drawing to an end.',
    'In the last truck he could see an aged man,',
    'his face a mass of grizzled hair, standing',
    'upright with wrists crossed in front of him,',
    'as though he were used to having them bound',
    'together. It was almost time for Winston',
    'and the girl to part. But at the last moment,',
    'while the crowd still hemmed them in, her',
    'hand felt for his and gave it a fleeting',
    'squeeze. It could not have been ten seconds,',
    'and yet it seemed a long time that their',
    'hands were clasped together. He had time',
    'to learn every detail of her hand. He explored',
    'the long fingers, the shapely nails, the',
    'work-hardened palm with its row of callouses,',
    'the smooth flesh under the wrist. Merely',
    'from feeling it he would have known it by',
    'sight. In the same instant it occurred to',
    'him that he did not know what colour the',
    'girl\'s eyes were. They were probably brown,',
    'but people with dark hair sometimes had blue',
    'eyes. To turn his head and look at her would',
    'have been inconceivable folly. With hands',
    'locked together, invisible among the press',
    'of bodies, they stared steadily in front',
    'of them, and instead of the eyes of the girl,',
    'the eyes of the aged prisoner gazed mournfully',
    'at Winston out of nests of hair. Chapter',
    '2 Winston picked his way up the lane through',
    'dappled light and shade, stepping out into',
    'pools of gold wherever the boughs parted.',
    'Under the trees to the left of him the ground',
    'was misty with bluebells. The air seemed',
    'to kiss one\'s skin. It was the second of',
    'May. From somewhere deeper in the heart of',
    'the wood came the droning of ring-doves.',
    'He was a bit early. There had been no difficulties',
    'about the journey, and the girl was so evidently',
    'experienced that he was less frightened than',
    'he would normally have been. Presumably she',
    'could be trusted to find a safe place. In',
    'general you could not assume that you were',
    'much safer in the country than in London.',
    'There were no telescreens, of course, but',
    'there was always the danger of concealed',
    'microphones by which your voice might be',
    'picked up and recognized; besides, it was',
    'not easy to make a journey by yourself without',
    'attracting attention. For distances of less',
    'than 100 kilometres it was not necessary',
    'to get your passport endorsed, but sometimes',
    'there were patrols hanging about the railway',
    'stations, who examined the papers of any',
    'Party member they found there and asked awkward',
    'questions. However, no patrols had appeared,',
    'and on the walk from the station he had made',
    'sure by cautious backward glances that he',
    'was not being followed. The train was full',
    'of proles, in holiday mood because of the',
    'summery weather. The wooden-seated carriage',
    'in which he travelled was filled to overflowing',
    'by a single enormous family, ranging from',
    'a toothless great-grandmother to a month-old',
    'baby, going out to spend an afternoon with',
    '\'in-laws\' in the country, and, as they freely',
    'explained to Winston, to get hold of a little',
    'black-market butter. The lane widened, and',
    'in a minute he came to the footpath she had',
    'told him of, a mere cattle-track which plunged',
    'between the bushes. He had no watch, but',
    'it could not be fifteen yet. The bluebells',
    'were so thick underfoot that it was impossible',
    'not to tread on them. He knelt down and began',
    'picking some partly to pass the time away,',
    'but also from a vague idea that he would',
    'like to have a bunch of flowers to offer',
    'to the girl when they met. He had got together',
    'a big bunch and was smelling their faint',
    'sickly scent when a sound at his back froze',
    'him, the unmistakable crackle of a foot on',
    'twigs. He went on picking bluebells. It was',
    'the best thing to do. It might be the girl,',
    'or he might have been followed after all.',
    'To look round was to show guilt. He picked',
    'another and another. A hand fell lightly',
    'on his shoulder. He looked up. It was the',
    'girl. She shook her head, evidently as a',
    'warning that he must keep silent, then parted',
    'the bushes and quickly led the way along',
    'the narrow track into the wood. Obviously',
    'she had been that way before, for she dodged',
    'the boggy bits as though by habit. Winston',
    'followed, still clasping his bunch of flowers.',
    'His first feeling was relief, but as he watched',
    'the strong slender body moving in front of',
    'him, with the scarlet sash that was just',
    'tight enough to bring out the curve of her',
    'hips, the sense of his own inferiority was',
    'heavy upon him. Even now it seemed quite',
    'likely that when she turned round and looked',
    'at him she would draw back after all. The',
    'sweetness of the air and the greenness of',
    'the leaves daunted him. Already on the walk',
    'from the station the May sunshine had made',
    'him feel dirty and etiolated, a creature',
    'of indoors, with the sooty dust of London',
    'in the pores of his skin. It occurred to',
    'him that till now she had probably never',
    'seen him in broad daylight in the open. They',
    'came to the fallen tree that she had spoken',
    'of. The girl hopped over and forced apart',
    'the bushes, in which there did not seem to',
    'be an opening. When Winston followed her,',
    'he found that they were in a natural clearing,',
    'a tiny grassy knoll surrounded by tall saplings',
    'that shut it in completely. The girl stopped',
    'and turned. \'Here we are,\' she said. He was',
    'facing her at several paces\' distance. As',
    'yet he did not dare move nearer to her. \'I',
    'didn\'t want to say anything in the lane,\'',
    'she went on, \'in case there\'s a mike hidden',
    'there. I don\'t suppose there is, but there',
    'could be. There\'s always the chance of one',
    'of those swine recognizing your voice. We\'re',
    'all right here.\' He still had not the courage',
    'to approach her. \'We\'re all right here?\'',
    'he repeated stupidly. \'Yes. Look at the trees.\'',
    'They were small ashes, which at some time',
    'had been cut down and had sprouted up again',
    'into a forest of poles, none of them thicker',
    'than one\'s wrist. \'There\'s nothing big enough',
    'to hide a mike in. Besides, I\'ve been here',
    'before.\' They were only making conversation.',
    'He had managed to move closer to her now.',
    'She stood before him very upright, with a',
    'smile on her face that looked faintly ironical,',
    'as though she were wondering why he was so',
    'slow to act. The bluebells had cascaded on',
    'to the ground. They seemed to have fallen',
    'of their own accord. He took her hand. \'Would',
    'you believe,\' he said, \'that till this moment',
    'I didn\'t know what colour your eyes were?\'',
    'They were brown, he noted, a rather light',
    'shade of brown, with dark lashes. \'Now that',
    'you\'ve seen what I\'m really like, can you',
    'still bear to look at me?\' \'Yes, easily.\'',
    '\'I\'m thirty-nine years old. I\'ve got a wife',
    'that I can\'t get rid of. I\'ve got varicose',
    'veins. I\'ve got five false teeth.\' \'I couldn\'t',
    'care less,\' said the girl. The next moment,',
    'it was hard to say by whose act, she was',
    'in his arms. At the beginning he had no feeling',
    'except sheer incredulity. The youthful body',
    'was strained against his own, the mass of',
    'dark hair was against his face, and yes!',
    'actually she had turned her face up and he',
    'was kissing the wide red mouth. She had clasped',
    'her arms about his neck, she was calling',
    'him darling, precious one, loved one. He',
    'had pulled her down on to the ground, she',
    'was utterly unresisting, he could do what',
    'he liked with her. But the truth was that',
    'he had no physical sensation, except that',
    'of mere contact. All he felt was incredulity',
    'and pride. He was glad that this was happening,',
    'but he had no physical desire. It was too',
    'soon, her youth and prettiness had frightened',
    'him, he was too much used to living without',
    'women, he did not know the reason. The girl',
    'picked herself up and pulled a bluebell out',
    'of her hair. She sat against him, putting',
    'her arm round his waist. \'Never mind, dear.',
    'There\'s no hurry. We\'ve got the whole afternoon.',
    'Isn\'t this a splendid hide-out? I found it',
    'when I got lost once on a community hike.',
    'If anyone was coming you could hear them',
    'a hundred metres away.\' \'What is your name?\'',
    'said Winston. \'Julia. I know yours. It\'s',
    'Winston, Winston Smith.\' \'How did you find',
    'that out?\' \'I expect I\'m better at finding',
    'things out than you are, dear. Tell me, what',
    'did you think of me before that day I gave',
    'you the note?\' He did not feel any temptation',
    'to tell lies to her. It was even a sort of',
    'love-offering to start off by telling the',
    'worst. \'I hated the sight of you,\' he said.',
    '\'I wanted to rape you and then murder you',
    'afterwards. Two weeks ago I thought seriously',
    'of smashing your head in with a cobblestone.',
    'If you really want to know, I imagined that',
    'you had something to do with the Thought',
    'Police.\' The girl laughed delightedly, evidently',
    'taking this as a tribute to the excellence',
    'of her disguise. \'Not the Thought Police!',
    'You didn\'t honestly think that?\' \'Well, perhaps',
    'not exactly that. But from your general appearance,',
    'merely because you\'re young and fresh and',
    'healthy, you understand, I thought that probably,',
    ', \' \'You thought I was a good Party member.',
    'Pure in word and deed. Banners, processions,',
    'slogans, games, community hikes all that',
    'stuff. And you thought that if I had a quarter',
    'of a chance I\'d denounce you as a thought-criminal',
    'and get you killed off?\' \'Yes, something',
    'of that kind. A great many young girls are',
    'like that, you know.\' \'It\'s this bloody thing',
    'that does it,\' she said, ripping off the',
    'scarlet sash of the Junior Anti-Sex League',
    'and flinging it on to a bough. Then, as though',
    'touching her waist had reminded her of something,',
    'she felt in the pocket of her overalls and',
    'produced a small slab of chocolate. She broke',
    'it in half and gave one of the pieces to',
    'Winston. Even before he had taken it he knew',
    'by the smell that it was very unusual chocolate.',
    'It was dark and shiny, and was wrapped in',
    'silver paper. Chocolate normally was dull-brown',
    'crumbly stuff that tasted, as nearly as one',
    'could describe it, like the smoke of a rubbish',
    'fire. But at some time or another he had',
    'tasted chocolate like the piece she had given',
    'him. The first whiff of its scent had stirred',
    'up some memory which he could not pin down,',
    'but which was powerful and troubling. \'Where',
    'did you get this stuff?\' he said. \'Black',
    'market,\' she said indifferently. \'Actually',
    'I am that sort of girl, to look at. I\'m good',
    'at games. I was a troop-leader in the Spies.',
    'I do voluntary work three evenings a week',
    'for the Junior Anti-Sex League. Hours and',
    'hours I\'ve spent pasting their bloody rot',
    'all over London. I always carry one end of',
    'a banner in the processions. I always look',
    'cheerful and I never shirk anything. Always',
    'yell with the crowd, that\'s what I say. It\'s',
    'the only way to be safe.\' The first fragment',
    'of chocolate had melted on Winston\'s tongue.',
    'The taste was delightful. But there was still',
    'that memory moving round the edges of his',
    'consciousness, something strongly felt but',
    'not reducible to definite shape, like an',
    'object seen out of the corner of one\'s eye.',
    'He pushed it away from him, aware only that',
    'it was the memory of some action which he',
    'would have liked to undo but could not. \'You',
    'are very young,\' he said. \'You are ten or',
    'fifteen years younger than I am. What could',
    'you see to attract you in a man like me?\'',
    '\'It was something in your face. I thought',
    'I\'d take a chance. I\'m good at spotting people',
    'who don\'t belong. As soon as I saw you I',
    'knew you were against THEM.\' THEM, it appeared,',
    'meant the Party, and above all the Inner',
    'Party, about whom she talked with an open',
    'jeering hatred which made Winston feel uneasy,',
    'although he knew that they were safe here',
    'if they could be safe anywhere. A thing that',
    'astonished him about her was the coarseness',
    'of her language. Party members were supposed',
    'not to swear, and Winston himself very seldom',
    'did swear, aloud, at any rate. Julia, however,',
    'seemed unable to mention the Party, and especially',
    'the Inner Party, without using the kind of',
    'words that you saw chalked up in dripping',
    'alley-ways. He did not dislike it. It was',
    'merely one symptom of her revolt against',
    'the Party and all its ways, and somehow it',
    'seemed natural and healthy, like the sneeze',
    'of a horse that smells bad hay. They had',
    'left the clearing and were wandering again',
    'through the chequered shade, with their arms',
    'round each other\'s waists whenever it was',
    'wide enough to walk two abreast. He noticed',
    'how much softer her waist seemed to feel',
    'now that the sash was gone. They did not',
    'speak above a whisper. Outside the clearing,',
    'Julia said, it was better to go quietly.',
    'Presently they had reached the edge of the',
    'little wood. She stopped him. \'Don\'t go out',
    'into the open. There might be someone watching.',
    'We\'re all right if we keep behind the boughs.\'',
    'They were standing in the shade of hazel',
    'bushes. The sunlight, filtering through innumerable',
    'leaves, was still hot on their faces. Winston',
    'looked out into the field beyond, and underwent',
    'a curious, slow shock of recognition. He',
    'knew it by sight. An old, close-bitten pasture,',
    'with a footpath wandering across it and a',
    'molehill here and there. In the ragged hedge',
    'on the opposite side the boughs of the elm',
    'trees swayed just perceptibly in the breeze,',
    'and their leaves stirred faintly in dense',
    'masses like women\'s hair. Surely somewhere',
    'nearby, but out of sight, there must be a',
    'stream with green pools where dace were swimming?',
    '\'Isn\'t there a stream somewhere near here?\'',
    'he whispered. \'That\'s right, there is a stream.',
    'It\'s at the edge of the next field, actually.',
    'There are fish in it, great big ones. You',
    'can watch them lying in the pools under the',
    'willow trees, waving their tails.\' \'It\'s',
    'the Golden Country, almost,\' he murmured.',
    '\'The Golden Country?\' \'It\'s nothing, really.',
    'A landscape I\'ve seen sometimes in a dream.\'',
    '\'Look!\' whispered Julia. A thrush had alighted',
    'on a bough not five metres away, almost at',
    'the level of their faces. Perhaps it had',
    'not seen them. It was in the sun, they in',
    'the shade. It spread out its wings, fitted',
    'them carefully into place again, ducked its',
    'head for a moment, as though making a sort',
    'of obeisance to the sun, and then began to',
    'pour forth a torrent of song. In the afternoon',
    'hush the volume of sound was startling. Winston',
    'and Julia clung together, fascinated. The',
    'music went on and on, minute after minute,',
    'with astonishing variations, never once repeating',
    'itself, almost as though the bird were deliberately',
    'showing off its virtuosity. Sometimes it',
    'stopped for a few seconds, spread out and',
    'resettled its wings, then swelled its speckled',
    'breast and again burst into song. Winston',
    'watched it with a sort of vague reverence.',
    'For whom, for what, was that bird singing?',
    'No mate, no rival was watching it. What made',
    'it sit at the edge of the lonely wood and',
    'pour its music into nothingness? He wondered',
    'whether after all there was a microphone',
    'hidden somewhere near. He and Julia had spoken',
    'only in low whispers, and it would not pick',
    'up what they had said, but it would pick',
    'up the thrush. Perhaps at the other end of',
    'the instrument some small, beetle-like man',
    'was listening intently, listening to that.',
    'But by degrees the flood of music drove all',
    'speculations out of his mind. It was as though',
    'it were a kind of liquid stuff that poured',
    'all over him and got mixed up with the sunlight',
    'that filtered through the leaves. He stopped',
    'thinking and merely felt. The girl\'s waist',
    'in the bend of his arm was soft and warm.',
    'He pulled her round so that they were breast',
    'to breast; her body seemed to melt into his.',
    'Wherever his hands moved it was all as yielding',
    'as water. Their mouths clung together; it',
    'was quite different from the hard kisses',
    'they had exchanged earlier. When they moved',
    'their faces apart again both of them sighed',
    'deeply. The bird took fright and fled with',
    'a clatter of wings. Winston put his lips',
    'against her ear. \'NOW,\' he whispered. \'Not',
    'here,\' she whispered back. \'Come back to',
    'the hide-out. It\'s safer.\' Quickly, with',
    'an occasional crackle of twigs, they threaded',
    'their way back to the clearing. When they',
    'were once inside the ring of saplings she',
    'turned and faced him. They were both breathing',
    'fast, but the smile had reappeared round',
    'the corners of her mouth. She stood looking',
    'at him for an instant, then felt at the zipper',
    'of her overalls. And, yes! it was almost',
    'as in his dream. Almost as swiftly as he',
    'had imagined it, she had torn her clothes',
    'off, and when she flung them aside it was',
    'with that same magnificent gesture by which',
    'a whole civilization seemed to be annihilated.',
    'Her body gleamed white in the sun. But for',
    'a moment he did not look at her body; his',
    'eyes were anchored by the freckled face with',
    'its faint, bold smile. He knelt down before',
    'her and took her hands in his. \'Have you',
    'done this before?\' \'Of course. Hundreds of',
    'times, well, scores of times, anyway.\' \'With',
    'Party members?\' \'Yes, always with Party members.\'',
    '\'With members of the Inner Party?\' \'Not with',
    'those swine, no. But there\'s plenty that',
    'WOULD if they got half a chance. They\'re',
    'not so holy as they make out.\' His heart',
    'leapt. Scores of times she had done it: he',
    'wished it had been hundreds, thousands. Anything',
    'that hinted at corruption always filled him',
    'with a wild hope. Who knew, perhaps the Party',
    'was rotten under the surface, its cult of',
    'strenuousness and self-denial simply a sham',
    'concealing iniquity. If he could have infected',
    'the whole lot of them with leprosy or syphilis,',
    'how gladly he would have done so! Anything',
    'to rot, to weaken, to undermine! He pulled',
    'her down so that they were kneeling face',
    'to face. \'Listen. The more men you\'ve had,',
    'the more I love you. Do you understand that?\'',
    '\'Yes, perfectly.\' \'I hate purity, I hate',
    'goodness! I don\'t want any virtue to exist',
    'anywhere. I want everyone to be corrupt to',
    'the bones.\' \'Well then, I ought to suit you,',
    'dear. I\'m corrupt to the bones.\' \'You like',
    'doing this? I don\'t mean simply me: I mean',
    'the thing in itself?\' \'I adore it.\' That',
    'was above all what he wanted to hear. Not',
    'merely the love of one person but the animal',
    'instinct, the simple undifferentiated desire:',
    'that was the force that would tear the Party',
    'to pieces. He pressed her down upon the grass,',
    'among the fallen bluebells. This time there',
    'was no difficulty. Presently the rising and',
    'falling of their breasts slowed to normal',
    'speed, and in a sort of pleasant helplessness',
    'they fell apart. The sun seemed to have grown',
    'hotter. They were both sleepy. He reached',
    'out for the discarded overalls and pulled',
    'them partly over her. Almost immediately',
    'they fell asleep and slept for about half',
    'an hour. Winston woke first. He sat up and',
    'watched the freckled face, still peacefully',
    'asleep, pillowed on the palm of her hand.',
    'Except for her mouth, you could not call',
    'her beautiful. There was a line or two round',
    'the eyes, if you looked closely. The short',
    'dark hair was extraordinarily thick and soft.',
    'It occurred to him that he still did not',
    'know her surname or where she lived. The',
    'young, strong body, now helpless in sleep,',
    'awoke in him a pitying, protecting feeling.',
    'But the mindless tenderness that he had felt',
    'under the hazel tree, while the thrush was',
    'singing, had not quite come back. He pulled',
    'the overalls aside and studied her smooth',
    'white flank. In the old days, he thought,',
    'a man looked at a girl\'s body and saw that',
    'it was desirable, and that was the end of',
    'the story. But you could not have pure love',
    'or pure lust nowadays. No emotion was pure,',
    'because everything was mixed up with fear',
    'and hatred. Their embrace had been a battle,',
    'the climax a victory. It was a blow struck',
    'against the Party. It was a political act.',
    'Chapter 3 \'We can come here once again,\'',
    'said Julia. \'It\'s generally safe to use any',
    'hide-out twice. But not for another month',
    'or two, of course.\' As soon as she woke up',
    'her demeanour had changed. She became alert',
    'and business-like, put her clothes on, knotted',
    'the scarlet sash about her waist, and began',
    'arranging the details of the journey home.',
    'It seemed natural to leave this to her. She',
    'obviously had a practical cunning which Winston',
    'lacked, and she seemed also to have an exhaustive',
    'knowledge of the countryside round London,',
    'stored away from innumerable community hikes.',
    'The route she gave him was quite different',
    'from the one by which he had come, and brought',
    'him out at a different railway station. \'Never',
    'go home the same way as you went out,\' she',
    'said, as though enunciating an important',
    'general principle. She would leave first,',
    'and Winston was to wait half an hour before',
    'following her. She had named a place where',
    'they could meet after work, four evenings',
    'hence. It was a street in one of the poorer',
    'quarters, where there was an open market',
    'which was generally crowded and noisy. She',
    'would be hanging about among the stalls,',
    'pretending to be in search of shoelaces or',
    'sewing-thread. If she judged that the coast',
    'was clear she would blow her nose when he',
    'approached; otherwise he was to walk past',
    'her without recognition. But with luck, in',
    'the middle of the crowd, it would be safe',
    'to talk for a quarter of an hour and arrange',
    'another meeting. \'And now I must go,\' she',
    'said as soon as he had mastered his instructions.',
    '\'I\'m due back at nineteen-thirty. I\'ve got',
    'to put in two hours for the Junior Anti-Sex',
    'League, handing out leaflets, or something.',
    'Isn\'t it bloody? Give me a brush-down, would',
    'you? Have I got any twigs in my hair? Are',
    'you sure? Then good-bye, my love, good-bye!\'',
    'She flung herself into his arms, kissed him',
    'almost violently, and a moment later pushed',
    'her way through the saplings and disappeared',
    'into the wood with very little noise. Even',
    'now he had not found out her surname or her',
    'address. However, it made no difference,',
    'for it was inconceivable that they could',
    'ever meet indoors or exchange any kind of',
    'written communication. As it happened, they',
    'never went back to the clearing in the wood.',
    'During the month of May there was only one',
    'further occasion on which they actually succeeded',
    'in making love. That was in another hiding-place',
    'known to Julia, the belfry of a ruinous church',
    'in an almost-deserted stretch of country',
    'where an atomic bomb had fallen thirty years',
    'earlier. It was a good hiding-place when',
    'once you got there, but the getting there',
    'was very dangerous. For the rest they could',
    'meet only in the streets, in a different',
    'place every evening and never for more than',
    'half an hour at a time. In the street it',
    'was usually possible to talk, after a fashion.',
    'As they drifted down the crowded pavements,',
    'not quite abreast and never looking at one',
    'another, they carried on a curious, intermittent',
    'conversation which flicked on and off like',
    'the beams of a lighthouse, suddenly nipped',
    'into silence by the approach of a Party uniform',
    'or the proximity of a telescreen, then taken',
    'up again minutes later in the middle of a',
    'sentence, then abruptly cut short as they',
    'parted at the agreed spot, then continued',
    'almost without introduction on the following',
    'day. Julia appeared to be quite used to this',
    'kind of conversation, which she called \'talking',
    'by instalments\'. She was also surprisingly',
    'adept at speaking without moving her lips.',
    'Just once in almost a month of nightly meetings',
    'they managed to exchange a kiss. They were',
    'passing in silence down a side-street (Julia',
    'would never speak when they were away from',
    'the main streets) when there was a deafening',
    'roar, the earth heaved, and the air darkened,',
    'and Winston found himself lying on his side,',
    'bruised and terrified. A rocket bomb must',
    'have dropped quite near at hand. Suddenly',
    'he became aware of Julia\'s face a few centimetres',
    'from his own, deathly white, as white as',
    'chalk. Even her lips were white. She was',
    'dead! He clasped her against him and found',
    'that he was kissing a live warm face. But',
    'there was some powdery stuff that got in',
    'the way of his lips. Both of their faces',
    'were thickly coated with plaster. There were',
    'evenings when they reached their rendezvous',
    'and then had to walk past one another without',
    'a sign, because a patrol had just come round',
    'the corner or a helicopter was hovering overhead.',
    'Even if it had been less dangerous, it would',
    'still have been difficult to find time to',
    'meet. Winston\'s working week was sixty hours,',
    'Julia\'s was even longer, and their free days',
    'varied according to the pressure of work',
    'and did not often coincide. Julia, in any',
    'case, seldom had an evening completely free.',
    'She spent an astonishing amount of time in',
    'attending lectures and demonstrations, distributing',
    'literature for the junior Anti-Sex League,',
    'preparing banners for Hate Week, making collections',
    'for the savings campaign, and such-like activities.',
    'It paid, she said, it was camouflage. If',
    'you kept the small rules, you could break',
    'the big ones. She even induced Winston to',
    'mortgage yet another of his evenings by enrolling',
    'himself for the part-time munition work which',
    'was done voluntarily by zealous Party members.',
    'So, one evening every week, Winston spent',
    'four hours of paralysing boredom, screwing',
    'together small bits of metal which were probably',
    'parts of bomb fuses, in a draughty, ill-lit',
    'workshop where the knocking of hammers mingled',
    'drearily with the music of the telescreens.',
    'When they met in the church tower the gaps',
    'in their fragmentary conversation were filled',
    'up. It was a blazing afternoon. The air in',
    'the little square chamber above the bells',
    'was hot and stagnant, and smelt overpoweringly',
    'of pigeon dung. They sat talking for hours',
    'on the dusty, twig-littered floor, one or',
    'other of them getting up from time to time',
    'to cast a glance through the arrowslits and',
    'make sure that no one was coming. Julia was',
    'twenty-six years old. She lived in a hostel',
    'with thirty other girls (\'Always in the stink',
    'of women! How I hate women!\' she said parenthetically),',
    'and she worked, as he had guessed, on the',
    'novel-writing machines in the Fiction Department.',
    'She enjoyed her work, which consisted chiefly',
    'in running and servicing a powerful but tricky',
    'electric motor. She was \'not clever\', but',
    'was fond of using her hands and felt at home',
    'with machinery. She could describe the whole',
    'process of composing a novel, from the general',
    'directive issued by the Planning Committee',
    'down to the final touching-up by the Rewrite',
    'Squad. But she was not interested in the',
    'finished product. She \'didn\'t much care for',
    'reading,\' she said. Books were just a commodity',
    'that had to be produced, like jam or bootlaces.',
    'She had no memories of anything before the',
    'early sixties and the only person she had',
    'ever known who talked frequently of the days',
    'before the Revolution was a grandfather who',
    'had disappeared when she was eight. At school',
    'she had been captain of the hockey team and',
    'had won the gymnastics trophy two years running.',
    'She had been a troop-leader in the Spies',
    'and a branch secretary in the Youth League',
    'before joining the Junior Anti-Sex League.',
    'She had always borne an excellent character.',
    'She had even (an infallible mark of good',
    'reputation) been picked out to work in Pornosec,',
    'the sub-section of the Fiction Department',
    'which turned out cheap pornography for distribution',
    'among the proles. It was nicknamed Muck House',
    'by the people who worked in it, she remarked.',
    'There she had remained for a year, helping',
    'to produce booklets in sealed packets with',
    'titles like \'Spanking Stories\' or \'One Night',
    'in a Girls\' School\', to be bought furtively',
    'by proletarian youths who were under the',
    'impression that they were buying something',
    'illegal. \'What are these books like?\' said',
    'Winston curiously. \'Oh, ghastly rubbish.',
    'They\'re boring, really. They only have six',
    'plots, but they swap them round a bit. Of',
    'course I was only on the kaleidoscopes. I',
    'was never in the Rewrite Squad. I\'m not literary,',
    'dear, not even enough for that.\' He learned',
    'with astonishment that all the workers in',
    'Pornosec, except the heads of the departments,',
    'were girls. The theory was that men, whose',
    'sex instincts were less controllable than',
    'those of women, were in greater danger of',
    'being corrupted by the filth they handled.',
    '\'They don\'t even like having married women',
    'there,\' she added. Girls are always supposed',
    'to be so pure. Here\'s one who isn\'t, anyway.',
    'She had had her first love-affair when she',
    'was sixteen, with a Party member of sixty',
    'who later committed suicide to avoid arrest.',
    '\'And a good job too,\' said Julia, \'otherwise',
    'they\'d have had my name out of him when he',
    'confessed.\' Since then there had been various',
    'others. Life as she saw it was quite simple.',
    'You wanted a good time; \'they\', meaning the',
    'Party, wanted to stop you having it; you',
    'broke the rules as best you could. She seemed',
    'to think it just as natural that \'they\' should',
    'want to rob you of your pleasures as that',
    'you should want to avoid being caught. She',
    'hated the Party, and said so in the crudest',
    'words, but she made no general criticism',
    'of it. Except where it touched upon her own',
    'life she had no interest in Party doctrine.',
    'He noticed that she never used Newspeak words',
    'except the ones that had passed into everyday',
    'use. She had never heard of the Brotherhood,',
    'and refused to believe in its existence.',
    'Any kind of organized revolt against the',
    'Party, which was bound to be a failure, struck',
    'her as stupid. The clever thing was to break',
    'the rules and stay alive all the same. He',
    'wondered vaguely how many others like her',
    'there might be in the younger generation',
    'people who had grown up in the world of the',
    'Revolution, knowing nothing else, accepting',
    'the Party as something unalterable, like',
    'the sky, not rebelling against its authority',
    'but simply evading it, as a rabbit dodges',
    'a dog. They did not discuss the possibility',
    'of getting married. It was too remote to',
    'be worth thinking about. No imaginable committee',
    'would ever sanction such a marriage even',
    'if Katharine, Winston\'s wife, could somehow',
    'have been got rid of. It was hopeless even',
    'as a daydream. \'What was she like, your wife?\'',
    'said Julia. \'She was, do you know the Newspeak',
    'word GOODTHINKFUL? Meaning naturally orthodox,',
    'incapable of thinking a bad thought?\' \'No,',
    'I didn\'t know the word, but I know the kind',
    'of person, right enough.\' He began telling',
    'her the story of his married life, but curiously',
    'enough she appeared to know the essential',
    'parts of it already. She described to him,',
    'almost as though she had seen or felt it,',
    'the stiffening of Katharine\'s body as soon',
    'as he touched her, the way in which she still',
    'seemed to be pushing him from her with all',
    'her strength, even when her arms were clasped',
    'tightly round him. With Julia he felt no',
    'difficulty in talking about such things:',
    'Katharine, in any case, had long ceased to',
    'be a painful memory and became merely a distasteful',
    'one. \'I could have stood it if it hadn\'t',
    'been for one thing,\' he said. He told her',
    'about the frigid little ceremony that Katharine',
    'had forced him to go through on the same',
    'night every week. \'She hated it, but nothing',
    'would make her stop doing it. She used to',
    'call it, but you\'ll never guess.\' \'Our duty',
    'to the Party,\' said Julia promptly. \'How',
    'did you know that?\' \'I\'ve been at school',
    'too, dear. Sex talks once a month for the',
    'over-sixteens. And in the Youth Movement.',
    'They rub it into you for years. I dare say',
    'it works in a lot of cases. But of course',
    'you can never tell; people are such hypocrites.\'',
    'She began to enlarge upon the subject. With',
    'Julia, everything came back to her own sexuality.',
    'As soon as this was touched upon in any way',
    'she was capable of great acuteness. Unlike',
    'Winston, she had grasped the inner meaning',
    'of the Party\'s sexual puritanism. It was',
    'not merely that the sex instinct created',
    'a world of its own which was outside the',
    'Party\'s control and which therefore had to',
    'be destroyed if possible. What was more important',
    'was that sexual privation induced hysteria,',
    'which was desirable because it could be transformed',
    'into war-fever and leader-worship. The way',
    'she put it was: \'When you make love you\'re',
    'using up energy; and afterwards you feel',
    'happy and don\'t give a damn for anything.',
    'They can\'t bear you to feel like that. They',
    'want you to be bursting with energy all the',
    'time. All this marching up and down and cheering',
    'and waving flags is simply sex gone sour.',
    'If you\'re happy inside yourself, why should',
    'you get excited about Big Brother and the',
    'Three-Year Plans and the Two Minutes Hate',
    'and all the rest of their bloody rot?\' That',
    'was very true, he thought. There was a direct',
    'intimate connexion between chastity and political',
    'orthodoxy. For how could the fear, the hatred,',
    'and the lunatic credulity which the Party',
    'needed in its members be kept at the right',
    'pitch, except by bottling down some powerful',
    'instinct and using it as a driving force?',
    'The sex impulse was dangerous to the Party,',
    'and the Party had turned it to account. They',
    'had played a similar trick with the instinct',
    'of parenthood. The family could not actually',
    'be abolished, and, indeed, people were encouraged',
    'to be fond of their children, in almost the',
    'old-fashioned way. The children, on the other',
    'hand, were systematically turned against',
    'their parents and taught to spy on them and',
    'report their deviations. The family had become',
    'in effect an extension of the Thought Police.',
    'It was a device by means of which everyone',
    'could be surrounded night and day by informers',
    'who knew him intimately. Abruptly his mind',
    'went back to Katharine. Katharine would unquestionably',
    'have denounced him to the Thought Police',
    'if she had not happened to be too stupid',
    'to detect the unorthodoxy of his opinions.',
    'But what really recalled her to him at this',
    'moment was the stifling heat of the afternoon,',
    'which had brought the sweat out on his forehead.',
    'He began telling Julia of something that',
    'had happened, or rather had failed to happen,',
    'on another sweltering summer afternoon, eleven',
    'years ago. It was three or four months after',
    'they were married. They had lost their way',
    'on a community hike somewhere in Kent. They',
    'had only lagged behind the others for a couple',
    'of minutes, but they took a wrong turning,',
    'and presently found themselves pulled up',
    'short by the edge of an old chalk quarry.',
    'It was a sheer drop of ten or twenty metres,',
    'with boulders at the bottom. There was nobody',
    'of whom they could ask the way. As soon as',
    'she realized that they were lost Katharine',
    'became very uneasy. To be away from the noisy',
    'mob of hikers even for a moment gave her',
    'a feeling of wrong-doing. She wanted to hurry',
    'back by the way they had come and start searching',
    'in the other direction. But at this moment',
    'Winston noticed some tufts of loosestrife',
    'growing in the cracks of the cliff beneath',
    'them. One tuft was of two colours, magenta',
    'and brick-red, apparently growing on the',
    'same root. He had never seen anything of',
    'the kind before, and he called to Katharine',
    'to come and look at it. \'Look, Katharine!',
    'Look at those flowers. That clump down near',
    'the bottom. Do you see they\'re two different',
    'colours?\' She had already turned to go, but',
    'she did rather fretfully come back for a',
    'moment. She even leaned out over the cliff',
    'face to see where he was pointing. He was',
    'standing a little behind her, and he put',
    'his hand on her waist to steady her. At this',
    'moment it suddenly occurred to him how completely',
    'alone they were. There was not a human creature',
    'anywhere, not a leaf stirring, not even a',
    'bird awake. In a place like this the danger',
    'that there would be a hidden microphone was',
    'very small, and even if there was a microphone',
    'it would only pick up sounds. It was the',
    'hottest sleepiest hour of the afternoon.',
    'The sun blazed down upon them, the sweat',
    'tickled his face. And the thought struck',
    'him. \'Why didn\'t you give her a good shove?\'',
    'said Julia. \'I would have.\' \'Yes, dear, you',
    'would have. I would, if I\'d been the same',
    'person then as I am now. Or perhaps I would,',
    'I\'m not certain.\' \'Are you sorry you didn\'t?\'',
    '\'Yes. On the whole I\'m sorry I didn\'t.\' They',
    'were sitting side by side on the dusty floor.',
    'He pulled her closer against him. Her head',
    'rested on his shoulder, the pleasant smell',
    'of her hair conquering the pigeon dung. She',
    'was very young, he thought, she still expected',
    'something from life, she did not understand',
    'that to push an inconvenient person over',
    'a cliff solves nothing. \'Actually it would',
    'have made no difference,\' he said. \'Then',
    'why are you sorry you didn\'t do it?\' \'Only',
    'because I prefer a positive to a negative.',
    'In this game that we\'re playing, we can\'t',
    'win. Some kinds of failure are better than',
    'other kinds, that\'s all.\' He felt her shoulders',
    'give a wriggle of dissent. She always contradicted',
    'him when he said anything of this kind. She',
    'would not accept it as a law of nature that',
    'the individual is always defeated. In a way',
    'she realized that she herself was doomed,',
    'that sooner or later the Thought Police would',
    'catch her and kill her, but with another',
    'part of her mind she believed that it was',
    'somehow possible to construct a secret world',
    'in which you could live as you chose. All',
    'you needed was luck and cunning and boldness.',
    'She did not understand that there was no',
    'such thing as happiness, that the only victory',
    'lay in the far future, long after you were',
    'dead, that from the moment of declaring war',
    'on the Party it was better to think of yourself',
    'as a corpse. \'We are the dead,\' he said.',
    '\'We\'re not dead yet,\' said Julia prosaically.',
    '\'Not physically. Six months, a year, five',
    'years, conceivably. I am afraid of death.',
    'You are young, so presumably you\'re more',
    'afraid of it than I am. Obviously we shall',
    'put it off as long as we can. But it makes',
    'very little difference. So long as human',
    'beings stay human, death and life are the',
    'same thing.\' \'Oh, rubbish! Which would you',
    'sooner sleep with, me or a skeleton? Don\'t',
    'you enjoy being alive? Don\'t you like feeling:',
    'This is me, this is my hand, this is my leg,',
    'I\'m real, I\'m solid, I\'m alive! Don\'t you',
    'like THIS?\' She twisted herself round and',
    'pressed her bosom against him. He could feel',
    'her breasts, ripe yet firm, through her overalls.',
    'Her body seemed to be pouring some of its',
    'youth and vigour into his. \'Yes, I like that,\'',
    'he said. \'Then stop talking about dying.',
    'And now listen, dear, we\'ve got to fix up',
    'about the next time we meet. We may as well',
    'go back to the place in the wood. We\'ve given',
    'it a good long rest. But you must get there',
    'by a different way this time. I\'ve got it',
    'all planned out. You take the train, but',
    'look, I\'ll draw it out for you.\' And in her',
    'practical way she scraped together a small',
    'square of dust, and with a twig from a pigeon\'s',
    'nest began drawing a map on the floor. Chapter',
    '4 Winston looked round the shabby little',
    'room above Mr Charrington\'s shop. Beside',
    'the window the enormous bed was made up,',
    'with ragged blankets and a coverless bolster.',
    'The old-fashioned clock with the twelve-hour',
    'face was ticking away on the mantelpiece.',
    'In the corner, on the gateleg table, the',
    'glass paperweight which he had bought on',
    'his last visit gleamed softly out of the',
    'half-darkness. In the fender was a battered',
    'tin oilstove, a saucepan, and two cups, provided',
    'by Mr Charrington. Winston lit the burner',
    'and set a pan of water to boil. He had brought',
    'an envelope full of Victory Coffee and some',
    'saccharine tablets. The clock\'s hands said',
    'seventeen-twenty: it was nineteen-twenty',
    'really. She was coming at nineteen-thirty.',
    'Folly, folly, his heart kept saying: conscious,',
    'gratuitous, suicidal folly. Of all the crimes',
    'that a Party member could commit, this one',
    'was the least possible to conceal. Actually',
    'the idea had first floated into his head',
    'in the form of a vision, of the glass paperweight',
    'mirrored by the surface of the gateleg table.',
    'As he had foreseen, Mr Charrington had made',
    'no difficulty about letting the room. He',
    'was obviously glad of the few dollars that',
    'it would bring him. Nor did he seem shocked',
    'or become offensively knowing when it was',
    'made clear that Winston wanted the room for',
    'the purpose of a love-affair. Instead he',
    'looked into the middle distance and spoke',
    'in generalities, with so delicate an air',
    'as to give the impression that he had become',
    'partly invisible. Privacy, he said, was a',
    'very valuable thing. Everyone wanted a place',
    'where they could be alone occasionally. And',
    'when they had such a place, it was only common',
    'courtesy in anyone else who knew of it to',
    'keep his knowledge to himself. He even, seeming',
    'almost to fade out of existence as he did',
    'so, added that there were two entries to',
    'the house, one of them through the back yard,',
    'which gave on an alley. Under the window',
    'somebody was singing. Winston peeped out,',
    'secure in the protection of the muslin curtain.',
    'The June sun was still high in the sky, and',
    'in the sun-filled court below, a monstrous',
    'woman, solid as a Norman pillar, with brawny',
    'red forearms and a sacking apron strapped',
    'about her middle, was stumping to and fro',
    'between a washtub and a clothes line, pegging',
    'out a series of square white things which',
    'Winston recognized as babies\' diapers. Whenever',
    'her mouth was not corked with clothes pegs',
    'she was singing in a powerful contralto:',
    'It was only an \'opeless fancy. It passed',
    'like an Ipril dye, But a look an\' a word',
    'an\' the dreams they stirred! They \'ave stolen',
    'my \'eart awye! The tune had been haunting',
    'London for weeks past. It was one of countless',
    'similar songs published for the benefit of',
    'the proles by a sub-section of the Music',
    'Department. The words of these songs were',
    'composed without any human intervention whatever',
    'on an instrument known as a versificator.',
    'But the woman sang so tunefully as to turn',
    'the dreadful rubbish into an almost pleasant',
    'sound. He could hear the woman singing and',
    'the scrape of her shoes on the flagstones,',
    'and the cries of the children in the street,',
    'and somewhere in the far distance a faint',
    'roar of traffic, and yet the room seemed',
    'curiously silent, thanks to the absence of',
    'a telescreen. Folly, folly, folly! he thought',
    'again. It was inconceivable that they could',
    'frequent this place for more than a few weeks',
    'without being caught. But the temptation',
    'of having a hiding-place that was truly their',
    'own, indoors and near at hand, had been too',
    'much for both of them. For some time after',
    'their visit to the church belfry it had been',
    'impossible to arrange meetings. Working hours',
    'had been drastically increased in anticipation',
    'of Hate Week. It was more than a month distant,',
    'but the enormous, complex preparations that',
    'it entailed were throwing extra work on to',
    'everybody. Finally both of them managed to',
    'secure a free afternoon on the same day.',
    'They had agreed to go back to the clearing',
    'in the wood. On the evening beforehand they',
    'met briefly in the street. As usual, Winston',
    'hardly looked at Julia as they drifted towards',
    'one another in the crowd, but from the short',
    'glance he gave her it seemed to him that',
    'she was paler than usual. \'It\'s all off,\'',
    'she murmured as soon as she judged it safe',
    'to speak. \'Tomorrow, I mean.\' \'What?\' \'Tomorrow',
    'afternoon. I can\'t come.\' \'Why not?\' \'Oh,',
    'the usual reason. It\'s started early this',
    'time.\' For a moment he was violently angry.',
    'During the month that he had known her the',
    'nature of his desire for her had changed.',
    'At the beginning there had been little true',
    'sensuality in it. Their first love-making',
    'had been simply an act of the will. But after',
    'the second time it was different. The smell',
    'of her hair, the taste of her mouth, the',
    'feeling of her skin seemed to have got inside',
    'him, or into the air all round him. She had',
    'become a physical necessity, something that',
    'he not only wanted but felt that he had a',
    'right to. When she said that she could not',
    'come, he had the feeling that she was cheating',
    'him. But just at this moment the crowd pressed',
    'them together and their hands accidentally',
    'met. She gave the tips of his fingers a quick',
    'squeeze that seemed to invite not desire',
    'but affection. It struck him that when one',
    'lived with a woman this particular disappointment',
    'must be a normal, recurring event; and a',
    'deep tenderness, such as he had not felt',
    'for her before, suddenly took hold of him.',
    'He wished that they were a married couple',
    'of ten years\' standing. He wished that he',
    'were walking through the streets with her',
    'just as they were doing now but openly and',
    'without fear, talking of trivialities and',
    'buying odds and ends for the household. He',
    'wished above all that they had some place',
    'where they could be alone together without',
    'feeling the obligation to make love every',
    'time they met. It was not actually at that',
    'moment, but at some time on the following',
    'day, that the idea of renting Mr Charrington\'s',
    'room had occurred to him. When he suggested',
    'it to Julia she had agreed with unexpected',
    'readiness. Both of them knew that it was',
    'lunacy. It was as though they were intentionally',
    'stepping nearer to their graves. As he sat',
    'waiting on the edge of the bed he thought',
    'again of the cellars of the Ministry of Love.',
    'It was curious how that predestined horror',
    'moved in and out of one\'s consciousness.',
    'There it lay, fixed in future times, preceding',
    'death as surely as 99 precedes 100. One could',
    'not avoid it, but one could perhaps postpone',
    'it: and yet instead, every now and again,',
    'by a conscious, wilful act, one chose to',
    'shorten the interval before it happened.',
    'At this moment there was a quick step on',
    'the stairs. Julia burst into the room. She',
    'was carrying a tool-bag of coarse brown canvas,',
    'such as he had sometimes seen her carrying',
    'to and fro at the Ministry. He started forward',
    'to take her in his arms, but she disengaged',
    'herself rather hurriedly, partly because',
    'she was still holding the tool-bag. \'Half',
    'a second,\' she said. \'Just let me show you',
    'what I\'ve brought. Did you bring some of',
    'that filthy Victory Coffee? I thought you',
    'would. You can chuck it away again, because',
    'we shan\'t be needing it. Look here.\' She',
    'fell on her knees, threw open the bag, and',
    'tumbled out some spanners and a screwdriver',
    'that filled the top part of it. Underneath',
    'were a number of neat paper packets. The',
    'first packet that she passed to Winston had',
    'a strange and yet vaguely familiar feeling.',
    'It was filled with some kind of heavy, sand-like',
    'stuff which yielded wherever you touched',
    'it. \'It isn\'t sugar?\' he said. \'Real sugar.',
    'Not saccharine, sugar. And here\'s a loaf',
    'of bread, proper white bread, not our bloody',
    'stuff, and a little pot of jam. And here\'s',
    'a tin of milk, but look! This is the one',
    'I\'m really proud of. I had to wrap a bit',
    'of sacking round it, because, , \' But she',
    'did not need to tell him why she had wrapped',
    'it up. The smell was already filling the',
    'room, a rich hot smell which seemed like',
    'an emanation from his early childhood, but',
    'which one did occasionally meet with even',
    'now, blowing down a passage-way before a',
    'door slammed, or diffusing itself mysteriously',
    'in a crowded street, sniffed for an instant',
    'and then lost again. \'It\'s coffee,\' he murmured,',
    '\'real coffee.\' \'It\'s Inner Party coffee.',
    'There\'s a whole kilo here,\' she said. \'How',
    'did you manage to get hold of all these things?\'',
    '\'It\'s all Inner Party stuff. There\'s nothing',
    'those swine don\'t have, nothing. But of course',
    'waiters and servants and people pinch things,',
    'and, look, I got a little packet of tea as',
    'well.\' Winston had squatted down beside her.',
    'He tore open a corner of the packet. \'It\'s',
    'real tea. Not blackberry leaves.\' \'There\'s',
    'been a lot of tea about lately. They\'ve captured',
    'India, or something,\' she said vaguely. \'But',
    'listen, dear. I want you to turn your back',
    'on me for three minutes. Go and sit on the',
    'other side of the bed. Don\'t go too near',
    'the window. And don\'t turn round till I tell',
    'you.\' Winston gazed abstractedly through',
    'the muslin curtain. Down in the yard the',
    'red-armed woman was still marching to and',
    'fro between the washtub and the line. She',
    'took two more pegs out of her mouth and sang',
    'with deep feeling: They sye that time \'eals',
    'all things, They sye you can always forget;',
    'But the smiles an\' the tears acrorss the',
    'years They twist my \'eart-strings yet! She',
    'knew the whole drivelling song by heart,',
    'it seemed. Her voice floated upward with',
    'the sweet summer air, very tuneful, charged',
    'with a sort of happy melancholy. One had',
    'the feeling that she would have been perfectly',
    'content, if the June evening had been endless',
    'and the supply of clothes inexhaustible,',
    'to remain there for a thousand years, pegging',
    'out diapers and singing rubbish. It struck',
    'him as a curious fact that he had never heard',
    'a member of the Party singing alone and spontaneously.',
    'It would even have seemed slightly unorthodox,',
    'a dangerous eccentricity, like talking to',
    'oneself. Perhaps it was only when people',
    'were somewhere near the starvation level',
    'that they had anything to sing about. \'You',
    'can turn round now,\' said Julia. He turned',
    'round, and for a second almost failed to',
    'recognize her. What he had actually expected',
    'was to see her naked. But she was not naked.',
    'The transformation that had happened was',
    'much more surprising than that. She had painted',
    'her face. She must have slipped into some',
    'shop in the proletarian quarters and bought',
    'herself a complete set of make-up materials.',
    'Her lips were deeply reddened, her cheeks',
    'rouged, her nose powdered; there was even',
    'a touch of something under the eyes to make',
    'them brighter. It was not very skilfully',
    'done, but Winston\'s standards in such matters',
    'were not high. He had never before seen or',
    'imagined a woman of the Party with cosmetics',
    'on her face. The improvement in her appearance',
    'was startling. With just a few dabs of colour',
    'in the right places she had become not only',
    'very much prettier, but, above all, far more',
    'feminine. Her short hair and boyish overalls',
    'merely added to the effect. As he took her',
    'in his arms a wave of synthetic violets flooded',
    'his nostrils. He remembered the half-darkness',
    'of a basement kitchen, and a woman\'s cavernous',
    'mouth. It was the very same scent that she',
    'had used; but at the moment it did not seem',
    'to matter. \'Scent too!\' he said. \'Yes, dear,',
    'scent too. And do you know what I\'m going',
    'to do next? I\'m going to get hold of a real',
    'woman\'s frock from somewhere and wear it',
    'instead of these bloody trousers. I\'ll wear',
    'silk stockings and high-heeled shoes! In',
    'this room I\'m going to be a woman, not a',
    'Party comrade.\' They flung their clothes',
    'off and climbed into the huge mahogany bed.',
    'It was the first time that he had stripped',
    'himself naked in her presence. Until now',
    'he had been too much ashamed of his pale',
    'and meagre body, with the varicose veins',
    'standing out on his calves and the discoloured',
    'patch over his ankle. There were no sheets,',
    'but the blanket they lay on was threadbare',
    'and smooth, and the size and springiness',
    'of the bed astonished both of them. \'It\'s',
    'sure to be full of bugs, but who cares?\'',
    'said Julia. One never saw a double bed nowadays,',
    'except in the homes of the proles. Winston',
    'had occasionally slept in one in his boyhood:',
    'Julia had never been in one before, so far',
    'as she could remember. Presently they fell',
    'asleep for a little while. When Winston woke',
    'up the hands of the clock had crept round',
    'to nearly nine. He did not stir, because',
    'Julia was sleeping with her head in the crook',
    'of his arm. Most of her make-up had transferred',
    'itself to his own face or the bolster, but',
    'a light stain of rouge still brought out',
    'the beauty of her cheekbone. A yellow ray',
    'from the sinking sun fell across the foot',
    'of the bed and lighted up the fireplace,',
    'where the water in the pan was boiling fast.',
    'Down in the yard the woman had stopped singing,',
    'but the faint shouts of children floated',
    'in from the street. He wondered vaguely whether',
    'in the abolished past it had been a normal',
    'experience to lie in bed like this, in the',
    'cool of a summer evening, a man and a woman',
    'with no clothes on, making love when they',
    'chose, talking of what they chose, not feeling',
    'any compulsion to get up, simply lying there',
    'and listening to peaceful sounds outside.',
    'Surely there could never have been a time',
    'when that seemed ordinary? Julia woke up,',
    'rubbed her eyes, and raised herself on her',
    'elbow to look at the oilstove. \'Half that',
    'water\'s boiled away,\' she said. \'I\'ll get',
    'up and make some coffee in another moment.',
    'We\'ve got an hour. What time do they cut',
    'the lights off at your flats?\' \'Twenty-three',
    'thirty.\' \'It\'s twenty-three at the hostel.',
    'But you have to get in earlier than that,',
    'because, Hi! Get out, you filthy brute!\'',
    'She suddenly twisted herself over in the',
    'bed, seized a shoe from the floor, and sent',
    'it hurtling into the corner with a boyish',
    'jerk of her arm, exactly as he had seen her',
    'fling the dictionary at Goldstein, that morning',
    'during the Two Minutes Hate. \'What was it?\'',
    'he said in surprise. \'A rat. I saw him stick',
    'his beastly nose out of the wainscoting.',
    'There\'s a hole down there. I gave him a good',
    'fright, anyway.\' \'Rats!\' murmured Winston.',
    '\'In this room!\' \'They\'re all over the place,\'',
    'said Julia indifferently as she lay down',
    'again. \'We\'ve even got them in the kitchen',
    'at the hostel. Some parts of London are swarming',
    'with them. Did you know they attack children?',
    'Yes, they do. In some of these streets a',
    'woman daren\'t leave a baby alone for two',
    'minutes. It\'s the great huge brown ones that',
    'do it. And the nasty thing is that the brutes',
    'always, , \' \'DON\'T GO ON!\' said Winston,',
    'with his eyes tightly shut. \'Dearest! You\'ve',
    'gone quite pale. What\'s the matter? Do they',
    'make you feel sick?\' \'Of all horrors in the',
    'world, a rat!\' She pressed herself against',
    'him and wound her limbs round him, as though',
    'to reassure him with the warmth of her body.',
    'He did not reopen his eyes immediately. For',
    'several moments he had had the feeling of',
    'being back in a nightmare which had recurred',
    'from time to time throughout his life. It',
    'was always very much the same. He was standing',
    'in front of a wall of darkness, and on the',
    'other side of it there was something unendurable,',
    'something too dreadful to be faced. In the',
    'dream his deepest feeling was always one',
    'of self-deception, because he did in fact',
    'know what was behind the wall of darkness.',
    'With a deadly effort, like wrenching a piece',
    'out of his own brain, he could even have',
    'dragged the thing into the open. He always',
    'woke up without discovering what it was:',
    'but somehow it was connected with what Julia',
    'had been saying when he cut her short. \'I\'m',
    'sorry,\' he said, \'it\'s nothing. I don\'t like',
    'rats, that\'s all.\' \'Don\'t worry, dear, we\'re',
    'not going to have the filthy brutes in here.',
    'I\'ll stuff the hole with a bit of sacking',
    'before we go. And next time we come here',
    'I\'ll bring some plaster and bung it up properly.\'',
    'Already the black instant of panic was half-forgotten.',
    'Feeling slightly ashamed of himself, he sat',
    'up against the bedhead. Julia got out of',
    'bed, pulled on her overalls, and made the',
    'coffee. The smell that rose from the saucepan',
    'was so powerful and exciting that they shut',
    'the window lest anybody outside should notice',
    'it and become inquisitive. What was even',
    'better than the taste of the coffee was the',
    'silky texture given to it by the sugar, a',
    'thing Winston had almost forgotten after',
    'years of saccharine. With one hand in her',
    'pocket and a piece of bread and jam in the',
    'other, Julia wandered about the room, glancing',
    'indifferently at the bookcase, pointing out',
    'the best way of repairing the gateleg table,',
    'plumping herself down in the ragged arm-chair',
    'to see if it was comfortable, and examining',
    'the absurd twelve-hour clock with a sort',
    'of tolerant amusement. She brought the glass',
    'paperweight over to the bed to have a look',
    'at it in a better light. He took it out of',
    'her hand, fascinated, as always, by the soft,',
    'rainwatery appearance of the glass. \'What',
    'is it, do you think?\' said Julia. \'I don\'t',
    'think it\'s anything, I mean, I don\'t think',
    'it was ever put to any use. That\'s what I',
    'like about it. It\'s a little chunk of history',
    'that they\'ve forgotten to alter. It\'s a message',
    'from a hundred years ago, if one knew how',
    'to read it.\' \'And that picture over there\',',
    'she nodded at the engraving on the opposite',
    'wall, \'would that be a hundred years old?\'',
    '\'More. Two hundred, I dare say. One can\'t',
    'tell. It\'s impossible to discover the age',
    'of anything nowadays.\' She went over to look',
    'at it. \'Here\'s where that brute stuck his',
    'nose out,\' she said, kicking the wainscoting',
    'immediately below the picture. \'What is this',
    'place? I\'ve seen it before somewhere.\' \'It\'s',
    'a church, or at least it used to be. St Clement',
    'Danes its name was.\' The fragment of rhyme',
    'that Mr Charrington had taught him came back',
    'into his head, and he added half-nostalgically:',
    '"Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St',
    'Clement\'s!" To his astonishment she capped',
    'the line: \'You owe me three farthings, say',
    'the bells of St Martin\'s, When will you pay',
    'me? say the bells of Old Bailey, , \' \'I can\'t',
    'remember how it goes on after that. But anyway',
    'I remember it ends up, "Here comes a candle',
    'to light you to bed, here comes a chopper',
    'to chop off your head!"\' It was like the',
    'two halves of a countersign. But there must',
    'be another line after \'the bells of Old Bailey\'.',
    'Perhaps it could be dug out of Mr Charrington\'s',
    'memory, if he were suitably prompted. \'Who',
    'taught you that?\' he said. \'My grandfather.',
    'He used to say it to me when I was a little',
    'girl. He was vaporized when I was eight,',
    'at any rate, he disappeared. I wonder what',
    'a lemon was,\' she added inconsequently. \'I\'ve',
    'seen oranges. They\'re a kind of round yellow',
    'fruit with a thick skin.\' \'I can remember',
    'lemons,\' said Winston. \'They were quite common',
    'in the fifties. They were so sour that it',
    'set your teeth on edge even to smell them.\'',
    '\'I bet that picture\'s got bugs behind it,\'',
    'said Julia. \'I\'ll take it down and give it',
    'a good clean some day. I suppose it\'s almost',
    'time we were leaving. I must start washing',
    'this paint off. What a bore! I\'ll get the',
    'lipstick off your face afterwards.\' Winston',
    'did not get up for a few minutes more. The',
    'room was darkening. He turned over towards',
    'the light and lay gazing into the glass paperweight.',
    'The inexhaustibly interesting thing was not',
    'the fragment of coral but the interior of',
    'the glass itself. There was such a depth',
    'of it, and yet it was almost as transparent',
    'as air. It was as though the surface of the',
    'glass had been the arch of the sky, enclosing',
    'a tiny world with its atmosphere complete.',
    'He had the feeling that he could get inside',
    'it, and that in fact he was inside it, along',
    'with the mahogany bed and the gateleg table,',
    'and the clock and the steel engraving and',
    'the paperweight itself. The paperweight was',
    'the room he was in, and the coral was Julia\'s',
    'life and his own, fixed in a sort of eternity',
    'at the heart of the crystal. Chapter 5 Syme',
    'had vanished. A morning came, and he was',
    'missing from work: a few thoughtless people',
    'commented on his absence. On the next day',
    'nobody mentioned him. On the third day Winston',
    'went into the vestibule of the Records Department',
    'to look at the notice-board. One of the notices',
    'carried a printed list of the members of',
    'the Chess Committee, of whom Syme had been',
    'one. It looked almost exactly as it had looked',
    'before, nothing had been crossed out, but',
    'it was one name shorter. It was enough. Syme',
    'had ceased to exist: he had never existed.',
    'The weather was baking hot. In the labyrinthine',
    'Ministry the windowless, air-conditioned',
    'rooms kept their normal temperature, but',
    'outside the pavements scorched one\'s feet',
    'and the stench of the Tubes at the rush hours',
    'was a horror. The preparations for Hate Week',
    'were in full swing, and the staffs of all',
    'the Ministries were working overtime. Processions,',
    'meetings, military parades, lectures, waxworks,',
    'displays, film shows, telescreen programmes',
    'all had to be organized; stands had to be',
    'erected, effigies built, slogans coined,',
    'songs written, rumours circulated, photographs',
    'faked. Julia\'s unit in the Fiction Department',
    'had been taken off the production of novels',
    'and was rushing out a series of atrocity',
    'pamphlets. Winston, in addition to his regular',
    'work, spent long periods every day in going',
    'through back files of \'The Times\' and altering',
    'and embellishing news items which were to',
    'be quoted in speeches. Late at night, when',
    'crowds of rowdy proles roamed the streets,',
    'the town had a curiously febrile air. The',
    'rocket bombs crashed oftener than ever, and',
    'sometimes in the far distance there were',
    'enormous explosions which no one could explain',
    'and about which there were wild rumours.',
    'The new tune which was to be the theme-song',
    'of Hate Week (the Hate Song, it was called)',
    'had already been composed and was being endlessly',
    'plugged on the telescreens. It had a savage,',
    'barking rhythm which could not exactly be',
    'called music, but resembled the beating of',
    'a drum. Roared out by hundreds of voices',
    'to the tramp of marching feet, it was terrifying.',
    'The proles had taken a fancy to it, and in',
    'the midnight streets it competed with the',
    'still-popular \'It was only a hopeless fancy\'.',
    'The Parsons children played it at all hours',
    'of the night and day, unbearably, on a comb',
    'and a piece of toilet paper. Winston\'s evenings',
    'were fuller than ever. Squads of volunteers,',
    'organized by Parsons, were preparing the',
    'street for Hate Week, stitching banners,',
    'painting posters, erecting flagstaffs on',
    'the roofs, and perilously slinging wires',
    'across the street for the reception of streamers.',
    'Parsons boasted that Victory Mansions alone',
    'would display four hundred metres of bunting.',
    'He was in his native element and as happy',
    'as a lark. The heat and the manual work had',
    'even given him a pretext for reverting to',
    'shorts and an open shirt in the evenings.',
    'He was everywhere at once, pushing, pulling,',
    'sawing, hammering, improvising, jollying',
    'everyone along with comradely exhortations',
    'and giving out from every fold of his body',
    'what seemed an inexhaustible supply of acrid-smelling',
    'sweat. A new poster had suddenly appeared',
    'all over London. It had no caption, and represented',
    'simply the monstrous figure of a Eurasian',
    'soldier, three or four metres high, striding',
    'forward with expressionless Mongolian face',
    'and enormous boots, a submachine gun pointed',
    'from his hip. From whatever angle you looked',
    'at the poster, the muzzle of the gun, magnified',
    'by the foreshortening, seemed to be pointed',
    'straight at you. The thing had been plastered',
    'on every blank space on every wall, even',
    'outnumbering the portraits of Big Brother.',
    'The proles, normally apathetic about the',
    'war, were being lashed into one of their',
    'periodical frenzies of patriotism. As though',
    'to harmonize with the general mood, the rocket',
    'bombs had been killing larger numbers of',
    'people than usual. One fell on a crowded',
    'film theatre in Stepney, burying several',
    'hundred victims among the ruins. The whole',
    'population of the neighbourhood turned out',
    'for a long, trailing funeral which went on',
    'for hours and was in effect an indignation',
    'meeting. Another bomb fell on a piece of',
    'waste ground which was used as a playground',
    'and several dozen children were blown to',
    'pieces. There were further angry demonstrations,',
    'Goldstein was burned in effigy, hundreds',
    'of copies of the poster of the Eurasian soldier',
    'were torn down and added to the flames, and',
    'a number of shops were looted in the turmoil;',
    'then a rumour flew round that spies were',
    'directing the rocket bombs by means of wireless',
    'waves, and an old couple who were suspected',
    'of being of foreign extraction had their',
    'house set on fire and perished of suffocation.',
    'In the room over Mr Charrington\'s shop, when',
    'they could get there, Julia and Winston lay',
    'side by side on a stripped bed under the',
    'open window, naked for the sake of coolness.',
    'The rat had never come back, but the bugs',
    'had multiplied hideously in the heat. It',
    'did not seem to matter. Dirty or clean, the',
    'room was paradise. As soon as they arrived',
    'they would sprinkle everything with pepper',
    'bought on the black market, tear off their',
    'clothes, and make love with sweating bodies,',
    'then fall asleep and wake to find that the',
    'bugs had rallied and were massing for the',
    'counter-attack. Four, five, six, seven times',
    'they met during the month of June. Winston',
    'had dropped his habit of drinking gin at',
    'all hours. He seemed to have lost the need',
    'for it. He had grown fatter, his varicose',
    'ulcer had subsided, leaving only a brown',
    'stain on the skin above his ankle, his fits',
    'of coughing in the early morning had stopped.',
    'The process of life had ceased to be intolerable,',
    'he had no longer any impulse to make faces',
    'at the telescreen or shout curses at the',
    'top of his voice. Now that they had a secure',
    'hiding-place, almost a home, it did not even',
    'seem a hardship that they could only meet',
    'infrequently and for a couple of hours at',
    'a time. What mattered was that the room over',
    'the junk-shop should exist. To know that',
    'it was there, inviolate, was almost the same',
    'as being in it. The room was a world, a pocket',
    'of the past where extinct animals could walk.',
    'Mr Charrington, thought Winston, was another',
    'extinct animal. He usually stopped to talk',
    'with Mr Charrington for a few minutes on',
    'his way upstairs. The old man seemed seldom',
    'or never to go out of doors, and on the other',
    'hand to have almost no customers. He led',
    'a ghostlike existence between the tiny, dark',
    'shop, and an even tinier back kitchen where',
    'he prepared his meals and which contained,',
    'among other things, an unbelievably ancient',
    'gramophone with an enormous horn. He seemed',
    'glad of the opportunity to talk. Wandering',
    'about among his worthless stock, with his',
    'long nose and thick spectacles and his bowed',
    'shoulders in the velvet jacket, he had always',
    'vaguely the air of being a collector rather',
    'than a tradesman. With a sort of faded enthusiasm',
    'he would finger this scrap of rubbish or',
    'that, a china bottle-stopper, the painted',
    'lid of a broken snuffbox, a pinchbeck locket',
    'containing a strand of some long-dead baby\'s',
    'hair, never asking that Winston should buy',
    'it, merely that he should admire it. To talk',
    'to him was like listening to the tinkling',
    'of a worn-out musical-box. He had dragged',
    'out from the corners of his memory some more',
    'fragments of forgotten rhymes. There was',
    'one about four and twenty blackbirds, and',
    'another about a cow with a crumpled horn,',
    'and another about the death of poor Cock',
    'Robin. \'It just occurred to me you might',
    'be interested,\' he would say with a deprecating',
    'little laugh whenever he produced a new fragment.',
    'But he could never recall more than a few',
    'lines of any one rhyme. Both of them knew,',
    'in a way, it was never out of their minds',
    'that what was now happening could not last',
    'long. There were times when the fact of impending',
    'death seemed as palpable as the bed they',
    'lay on, and they would cling together with',
    'a sort of despairing sensuality, like a damned',
    'soul grasping at his last morsel of pleasure',
    'when the clock is within five minutes of',
    'striking. But there were also times when',
    'they had the illusion not only of safety',
    'but of permanence. So long as they were actually',
    'in this room, they both felt, no harm could',
    'come to them. Getting there was difficult',
    'and dangerous, but the room itself was sanctuary.',
    'It was as when Winston had gazed into the',
    'heart of the paperweight, with the feeling',
    'that it would be possible to get inside that',
    'glassy world, and that once inside it time',
    'could be arrested. Often they gave themselves',
    'up to daydreams of escape. Their luck would',
    'hold indefinitely, and they would carry on',
    'their intrigue, just like this, for the remainder',
    'of their natural lives. Or Katharine would',
    'die, and by subtle manoeuvrings Winston and',
    'Julia would succeed in getting married. Or',
    'they would commit suicide together. Or they',
    'would disappear, alter themselves out of',
    'recognition, learn to speak with proletarian',
    'accents, get jobs in a factory and live out',
    'their lives undetected in a back-street.',
    'It was all nonsense, as they both knew. In',
    'reality there was no escape. Even the one',
    'plan that was practicable, suicide, they',
    'had no intention of carrying out. To hang',
    'on from day to day and from week to week,',
    'spinning out a present that had no future,',
    'seemed an unconquerable instinct, just as',
    'one\'s lungs will always draw the next breath',
    'so long as there is air available. Sometimes,',
    'too, they talked of engaging in active rebellion',
    'against the Party, but with no notion of',
    'how to take the first step. Even if the fabulous',
    'Brotherhood was a reality, there still remained',
    'the difficulty of finding one\'s way into',
    'it. He told her of the strange intimacy that',
    'existed, or seemed to exist, between himself',
    'and O\'Brien, and of the impulse he sometimes',
    'felt, simply to walk into O\'Brien\'s presence,',
    'announce that he was the enemy of the Party,',
    'and demand his help. Curiously enough, this',
    'did not strike her as an impossibly rash',
    'thing to do. She was used to judging people',
    'by their faces, and it seemed natural to',
    'her that Winston should believe O\'Brien to',
    'be trustworthy on the strength of a single',
    'flash of the eyes. Moreover she took it for',
    'granted that everyone, or nearly everyone,',
    'secretly hated the Party and would break',
    'the rules if he thought it safe to do so.',
    'But she refused to believe that widespread,',
    'organized opposition existed or could exist.',
    'The tales about Goldstein and his underground',
    'army, she said, were simply a lot of rubbish',
    'which the Party had invented for its own',
    'purposes and which you had to pretend to',
    'believe in. Times beyond number, at Party',
    'rallies and spontaneous demonstrations, she',
    'had shouted at the top of her voice for the',
    'execution of people whose names she had never',
    'heard and in whose supposed crimes she had',
    'not the faintest belief. When public trials',
    'were happening she had taken her place in',
    'the detachments from the Youth League who',
    'surrounded the courts from morning to night,',
    'chanting at intervals \'Death to the traitors!\'',
    'During the Two Minutes Hate she always excelled',
    'all others in shouting insults at Goldstein.',
    'Yet she had only the dimmest idea of who',
    'Goldstein was and what doctrines he was supposed',
    'to represent. She had grown up since the',
    'Revolution and was too young to remember',
    'the ideological battles of the fifties and',
    'sixties. Such a thing as an independent political',
    'movement was outside her imagination: and',
    'in any case the Party was invincible. It',
    'would always exist, and it would always be',
    'the same. You could only rebel against it',
    'by secret disobedience or, at most, by isolated',
    'acts of violence such as killing somebody',
    'or blowing something up. In some ways she',
    'was far more acute than Winston, and far',
    'less susceptible to Party propaganda. Once',
    'when he happened in some connexion to mention',
    'the war against Eurasia, she startled him',
    'by saying casually that in her opinion the',
    'war was not happening. The rocket bombs which',
    'fell daily on London were probably fired',
    'by the Government of Oceania itself, \'just',
    'to keep people frightened\'. This was an idea',
    'that had literally never occurred to him.',
    'She also stirred a sort of envy in him by',
    'telling him that during the Two Minutes Hate',
    'her great difficulty was to avoid bursting',
    'out laughing. But she only questioned the',
    'teachings of the Party when they in some',
    'way touched upon her own life. Often she',
    'was ready to accept the official mythology,',
    'simply because the difference between truth',
    'and falsehood did not seem important to her.',
    'She believed, for instance, having learnt',
    'it at school, that the Party had invented',
    'aeroplanes. (In his own schooldays, Winston',
    'remembered, in the late fifties, it was only',
    'the helicopter that the Party claimed to',
    'have invented; a dozen years later, when',
    'Julia was at school, it was already claiming',
    'the aeroplane; one generation more, and it',
    'would be claiming the steam engine.) And',
    'when he told her that aeroplanes had been',
    'in existence before he was born and long',
    'before the Revolution, the fact struck her',
    'as totally uninteresting. After all, what',
    'did it matter who had invented aeroplanes?',
    'It was rather more of a shock to him when',
    'he discovered from some chance remark that',
    'she did not remember that Oceania, four years',
    'ago, had been at war with Eastasia and at',
    'peace with Eurasia. It was true that she',
    'regarded the whole war as a sham: but apparently',
    'she had not even noticed that the name of',
    'the enemy had changed. \'I thought we\'d always',
    'been at war with Eurasia,\' she said vaguely.',
    'It frightened him a little. The invention',
    'of aeroplanes dated from long before her',
    'birth, but the switchover in the war had',
    'happened only four years ago, well after',
    'she was grown up. He argued with her about',
    'it for perhaps a quarter of an hour. In the',
    'end he succeeded in forcing her memory back',
    'until she did dimly recall that at one time',
    'Eastasia and not Eurasia had been the enemy.',
    'But the issue still struck her as unimportant.',
    '\'Who cares?\' she said impatiently. \'It\'s',
    'always one bloody war after another, and',
    'one knows the news is all lies anyway.\' Sometimes',
    'he talked to her of the Records Department',
    'and the impudent forgeries that he committed',
    'there. Such things did not appear to horrify',
    'her. She did not feel the abyss opening beneath',
    'her feet at the thought of lies becoming',
    'truths. He told her the story of Jones, Aaronson,',
    'and Rutherford and the momentous slip of',
    'paper which he had once held between his',
    'fingers. It did not make much impression',
    'on her. At first, indeed, she failed to grasp',
    'the point of the story. \'Were they friends',
    'of yours?\' she said. \'No, I never knew them.',
    'They were Inner Party members. Besides, they',
    'were far older men than I was. They belonged',
    'to the old days, before the Revolution. I',
    'barely knew them by sight.\' \'Then what was',
    'there to worry about? People are being killed',
    'off all the time, aren\'t they?\' He tried',
    'to make her understand. \'This was an exceptional',
    'case. It wasn\'t just a question of somebody',
    'being killed. Do you realize that the past,',
    'starting from yesterday, has been actually',
    'abolished? If it survives anywhere, it\'s',
    'in a few solid objects with no words attached',
    'to them, like that lump of glass there. Already',
    'we know almost literally nothing about the',
    'Revolution and the years before the Revolution.',
    'Every record has been destroyed or falsified,',
    'every book has been rewritten, every picture',
    'has been repainted, every statue and street',
    'and building has been renamed, every date',
    'has been altered. And that process is continuing',
    'day by day and minute by minute. History',
    'has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless',
    'present in which the Party is always right.',
    'I know, of course, that the past is falsified,',
    'but it would never be possible for me to',
    'prove it, even when I did the falsification',
    'myself. After the thing is done, no evidence',
    'ever remains. The only evidence is inside',
    'my own mind, and I don\'t know with any certainty',
    'that any other human being shares my memories.',
    'Just in that one instance, in my whole life,',
    'I did possess actual concrete evidence after',
    'the event, years after it.\' \'And what good',
    'was that?\' \'It was no good, because I threw',
    'it away a few minutes later. But if the same',
    'thing happened today, I should keep it.\'',
    '\'Well, I wouldn\'t!\' said Julia. \'I\'m quite',
    'ready to take risks, but only for something',
    'worth while, not for bits of old newspaper.',
    'What could you have done with it even if',
    'you had kept it?\' \'Not much, perhaps. But',
    'it was evidence. It might have planted a',
    'few doubts here and there, supposing that',
    'I\'d dared to show it to anybody. I don\'t',
    'imagine that we can alter anything in our',
    'own lifetime. But one can imagine little',
    'knots of resistance springing up here and',
    'there, small groups of people banding themselves',
    'together, and gradually growing, and even',
    'leaving a few records behind, so that the',
    'next generations can carry on where we leave',
    'off.\' \'I\'m not interested in the next generation,',
    'dear. I\'m interested in US.\' \'You\'re only',
    'a rebel from the waist downwards,\' he told',
    'her. She thought this brilliantly witty and',
    'flung her arms round him in delight. In the',
    'ramifications of party doctrine she had not',
    'the faintest interest. Whenever he began',
    'to talk of the principles of Ingsoc, doublethink,',
    'the mutability of the past, and the denial',
    'of objective reality, and to use Newspeak',
    'words, she became bored and confused and',
    'said that she never paid any attention to',
    'that kind of thing. One knew that it was',
    'all rubbish, so why let oneself be worried',
    'by it? She knew when to cheer and when to',
    'boo, and that was all one needed. If he persisted',
    'in talking of such subjects, she had a disconcerting',
    'habit of falling asleep. She was one of those',
    'people who can go to sleep at any hour and',
    'in any position. Talking to her, he realized',
    'how easy it was to present an appearance',
    'of orthodoxy while having no grasp whatever',
    'of what orthodoxy meant. In a way, the world-view',
    'of the Party imposed itself most successfully',
    'on people incapable of understanding it.',
    'They could be made to accept the most flagrant',
    'violations of reality, because they never',
    'fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded',
    'of them, and were not sufficiently interested',
    'in public events to notice what was happening.',
    'By lack of understanding they remained sane.',
    'They simply swallowed everything, and what',
    'they swallowed did them no harm, because',
    'it left no residue behind, just as a grain',
    'of corn will pass undigested through the',
    'body of a bird. Chapter 6 It had happened',
    'at last. The expected message had come. All',
    'his life, it seemed to him, he had been waiting',
    'for this to happen. He was walking down the',
    'long corridor at the Ministry and he was',
    'almost at the spot where Julia had slipped',
    'the note into his hand when he became aware',
    'that someone larger than himself was walking',
    'just behind him. The person, whoever it was,',
    'gave a small cough, evidently as a prelude',
    'to speaking. Winston stopped abruptly and',
    'turned. It was O\'Brien. At last they were',
    'face to face, and it seemed that his only',
    'impulse was to run away. His heart bounded',
    'violently. He would have been incapable of',
    'speaking. O\'Brien, however, had continued',
    'forward in the same movement, laying a friendly',
    'hand for a moment on Winston\'s arm, so that',
    'the two of them were walking side by side.',
    'He began speaking with the peculiar grave',
    'courtesy that differentiated him from the',
    'majority of Inner Party members. \'I had been',
    'hoping for an opportunity of talking to you,\'',
    'he said. \'I was reading one of your Newspeak',
    'articles in \'The Times\' the other day. You',
    'take a scholarly interest in Newspeak, I',
    'believe?\' Winston had recovered part of his',
    'self-possession. \'Hardly scholarly,\' he said.',
    '\'I\'m only an amateur. It\'s not my subject.',
    'I have never had anything to do with the',
    'actual construction of the language.\' \'But',
    'you write it very elegantly,\' said O\'Brien.',
    '\'That is not only my own opinion. I was talking',
    'recently to a friend of yours who is certainly',
    'an expert. His name has slipped my memory',
    'for the moment.\' Again Winston\'s heart stirred',
    'painfully. It was inconceivable that this',
    'was anything other than a reference to Syme.',
    'But Syme was not only dead, he was abolished,',
    'an unperson. Any identifiable reference to',
    'him would have been mortally dangerous. O\'Brien\'s',
    'remark must obviously have been intended',
    'as a signal, a codeword. By sharing a small',
    'act of thoughtcrime he had turned the two',
    'of them into accomplices. They had continued',
    'to stroll slowly down the corridor, but now',
    'O\'Brien halted. With the curious, disarming',
    'friendliness that he always managed to put',
    'in to the gesture he resettled his spectacles',
    'on his nose. Then he went on: \'What I had',
    'really intended to say was that in your article',
    'I noticed you had used two words which have',
    'become obsolete. But they have only become',
    'so very recently. Have you seen the tenth',
    'edition of the Newspeak Dictionary?\' \'No,\'',
    'said Winston. \'I didn\'t think it had been',
    'issued yet. We are still using the ninth',
    'in the Records Department.\' \'The tenth edition',
    'is not due to appear for some months, I believe.',
    'But a few advance copies have been circulated.',
    'I have one myself. It might interest you',
    'to look at it, perhaps?\' \'Very much so,\'',
    'said Winston, immediately seeing where this',
    'tended. \'Some of the new developments are',
    'most ingenious. The reduction in the number',
    'of verbs, that is the point that will appeal',
    'to you, I think. Let me see, shall I send',
    'a messenger to you with the dictionary? But',
    'I am afraid I invariably forget anything',
    'of that kind. Perhaps you could pick it up',
    'at my flat at some time that suited you?',
    'Wait. Let me give you my address.\' They were',
    'standing in front of a telescreen. Somewhat',
    'absent-mindedly O\'Brien felt two of his pockets',
    'and then produced a small leather-covered',
    'notebook and a gold ink-pencil. Immediately',
    'beneath the telescreen, in such a position',
    'that anyone who was watching at the other',
    'end of the instrument could read what he',
    'was writing, he scribbled an address, tore',
    'out the page and handed it to Winston. \'I',
    'am usually at home in the evenings,\' he said.',
    '\'If not, my servant will give you the dictionary.\'',
    'He was gone, leaving Winston holding the',
    'scrap of paper, which this time there was',
    'no need to conceal. Nevertheless he carefully',
    'memorized what was written on it, and some',
    'hours later dropped it into the memory hole',
    'along with a mass of other papers. They had',
    'been talking to one another for a couple',
    'of minutes at the most. There was only one',
    'meaning that the episode could possibly have.',
    'It had been contrived as a way of letting',
    'Winston know O\'Brien\'s address. This was',
    'necessary, because except by direct enquiry',
    'it was never possible to discover where anyone',
    'lived. There were no directories of any kind.',
    '\'If you ever want to see me, this is where',
    'I can be found,\' was what O\'Brien had been',
    'saying to him. Perhaps there would even be',
    'a message concealed somewhere in the dictionary.',
    'But at any rate, one thing was certain. The',
    'conspiracy that he had dreamed of did exist,',
    'and he had reached the outer edges of it.',
    'He knew that sooner or later he would obey',
    'O\'Brien\'s summons. Perhaps tomorrow, perhaps',
    'after a long delay, he was not certain. What',
    'was happening was only the working-out of',
    'a process that had started years ago. The',
    'first step had been a secret, involuntary',
    'thought, the second had been the opening',
    'of the diary. He had moved from thoughts',
    'to words, and now from words to actions.',
    'The last step was something that would happen',
    'in the Ministry of Love. He had accepted',
    'it. The end was contained in the beginning.',
    'But it was frightening: or, more exactly,',
    'it was like a foretaste of death, like being',
    'a little less alive. Even while he was speaking',
    'to O\'Brien, when the meaning of the words',
    'had sunk in, a chilly shuddering feeling',
    'had taken possession of his body. He had',
    'the sensation of stepping into the dampness',
    'of a grave, and it was not much better because',
    'he had always known that the grave was there',
    'and waiting for him. Chapter 7 Winston had',
    'woken up with his eyes full of tears. Julia',
    'rolled sleepily against him, murmuring something',
    'that might have been \'What\'s the matter?\'',
    '\'I dreamt, \' he began, and stopped short.',
    'It was too complex to be put into words.',
    'There was the dream itself, and there was',
    'a memory connected with it that had swum',
    'into his mind in the few seconds after waking.',
    'He lay back with his eyes shut, still sodden',
    'in the atmosphere of the dream. It was a',
    'vast, luminous dream in which his whole life',
    'seemed to stretch out before him like a landscape',
    'on a summer evening after rain. It had all',
    'occurred inside the glass paperweight, but',
    'the surface of the glass was the dome of',
    'the sky, and inside the dome everything was',
    'flooded with clear soft light in which one',
    'could see into interminable distances. The',
    'dream had also been comprehended by, indeed,',
    'in some sense it had consisted in, a gesture',
    'of the arm made by his mother, and made again',
    'thirty years later by the Jewish woman he',
    'had seen on the news film, trying to shelter',
    'the small boy from the bullets, before the',
    'helicopter blew them both to pieces. \'Do',
    'you know,\' he said, \'that until this moment',
    'I believed I had murdered my mother?\' \'Why',
    'did you murder her?\' said Julia, almost asleep.',
    '\'I didn\'t murder her. Not physically.\' In',
    'the dream he had remembered his last glimpse',
    'of his mother, and within a few moments of',
    'waking the cluster of small events surrounding',
    'it had all come back. It was a memory that',
    'he must have deliberately pushed out of his',
    'consciousness over many years. He was not',
    'certain of the date, but he could not have',
    'been less than ten years old, possibly twelve,',
    'when it had happened. His father had disappeared',
    'some time earlier, how much earlier he could',
    'not remember. He remembered better the rackety,',
    'uneasy circumstances of the time: the periodical',
    'panics about air-raids and the sheltering',
    'in Tube stations, the piles of rubble everywhere,',
    'the unintelligible proclamations posted at',
    'street corners, the gangs of youths in shirts',
    'all the same colour, the enormous queues',
    'outside the bakeries, the intermittent machine-gun',
    'fire in the distance, above all, the fact',
    'that there was never enough to eat. He remembered',
    'long afternoons spent with other boys in',
    'scrounging round dustbins and rubbish heaps,',
    'picking out the ribs of cabbage leaves, potato',
    'peelings, sometimes even scraps of stale',
    'breadcrust from which they carefully scraped',
    'away the cinders; and also in waiting for',
    'the passing of trucks which travelled over',
    'a certain route and were known to carry cattle',
    'feed, and which, when they jolted over the',
    'bad patches in the road, sometimes spilt',
    'a few fragments of oil-cake. When his father',
    'disappeared, his mother did not show any',
    'surprise or any violent grief, but a sudden',
    'change came over her. She seemed to have',
    'become completely spiritless. It was evident',
    'even to Winston that she was waiting for',
    'something that she knew must happen. She',
    'did everything that was needed, cooked, washed,',
    'mended, made the bed, swept the floor, dusted',
    'the mantelpiece, always very slowly and with',
    'a curious lack of superfluous motion, like',
    'an artist\'s lay-figure moving of its own',
    'accord. Her large shapely body seemed to',
    'relapse naturally into stillness. For hours',
    'at a time she would sit almost immobile on',
    'the bed, nursing his young sister, a tiny,',
    'ailing, very silent child of two or three,',
    'with a face made simian by thinness. Very',
    'occasionally she would take Winston in her',
    'arms and press him against her for a long',
    'time without saying anything. He was aware,',
    'in spite of his youthfulness and selfishness,',
    'that this was somehow connected with the',
    'never-mentioned thing that was about to happen.',
    'He remembered the room where they lived,',
    'a dark, close-smelling room that seemed half',
    'filled by a bed with a white counterpane.',
    'There was a gas ring in the fender, and a',
    'shelf where food was kept, and on the landing',
    'outside there was a brown earthenware sink,',
    'common to several rooms. He remembered his',
    'mother\'s statuesque body bending over the',
    'gas ring to stir at something in a saucepan.',
    'Above all he remembered his continuous hunger,',
    'and the fierce sordid battles at mealtimes.',
    'He would ask his mother naggingly, over and',
    'over again, why there was not more food,',
    'he would shout and storm at her (he even',
    'remembered the tones of his voice, which',
    'was beginning to break prematurely and sometimes',
    'boomed in a peculiar way), or he would attempt',
    'a snivelling note of pathos in his efforts',
    'to get more than his share. His mother was',
    'quite ready to give him more than his share.',
    'She took it for granted that he, \'the boy\',',
    'should have the biggest portion; but however',
    'much she gave him he invariably demanded',
    'more. At every meal she would beseech him',
    'not to be selfish and to remember that his',
    'little sister was sick and also needed food,',
    'but it was no use. He would cry out with',
    'rage when she stopped ladling, he would try',
    'to wrench the saucepan and spoon out of her',
    'hands, he would grab bits from his sister\'s',
    'plate. He knew that he was starving the other',
    'two, but he could not help it; he even felt',
    'that he had a right to do it. The clamorous',
    'hunger in his belly seemed to justify him.',
    'Between meals, if his mother did not stand',
    'guard, he was constantly pilfering at the',
    'wretched store of food on the shelf. One',
    'day a chocolate ration was issued. There',
    'had been no such issue for weeks or months',
    'past. He remembered quite clearly that precious',
    'little morsel of chocolate. It was a two-ounce',
    'slab (they still talked about ounces in those',
    'days) between the three of them. It was obvious',
    'that it ought to be divided into three equal',
    'parts. Suddenly, as though he were listening',
    'to somebody else, Winston heard himself demanding',
    'in a loud booming voice that he should be',
    'given the whole piece. His mother told him',
    'not to be greedy. There was a long, nagging',
    'argument that went round and round, with',
    'shouts, whines, tears, remonstrances, bargainings.',
    'His tiny sister, clinging to her mother with',
    'both hands, exactly like a baby monkey, sat',
    'looking over her shoulder at him with large,',
    'mournful eyes. In the end his mother broke',
    'off three-quarters of the chocolate and gave',
    'it to Winston, giving the other quarter to',
    'his sister. The little girl took hold of',
    'it and looked at it dully, perhaps not knowing',
    'what it was. Winston stood watching her for',
    'a moment. Then with a sudden swift spring',
    'he had snatched the piece of chocolate out',
    'of his sister\'s hand and was fleeing for',
    'the door. \'Winston, Winston!\' his mother',
    'called after him. \'Come back! Give your sister',
    'back her chocolate!\' He stopped, but did',
    'not come back. His mother\'s anxious eyes',
    'were fixed on his face. Even now he was thinking',
    'about the thing, he did not know what it',
    'was that was on the point of happening. His',
    'sister, conscious of having been robbed of',
    'something, had set up a feeble wail. His',
    'mother drew her arm round the child and pressed',
    'its face against her breast. Something in',
    'the gesture told him that his sister was',
    'dying. He turned and fled down the stairs,',
    'with the chocolate growing sticky in his',
    'hand. He never saw his mother again. After',
    'he had devoured the chocolate he felt somewhat',
    'ashamed of himself and hung about in the',
    'streets for several hours, until hunger drove',
    'him home. When he came back his mother had',
    'disappeared. This was already becoming normal',
    'at that time. Nothing was gone from the room',
    'except his mother and his sister. They had',
    'not taken any clothes, not even his mother\'s',
    'overcoat. To this day he did not know with',
    'any certainty that his mother was dead. It',
    'was perfectly possible that she had merely',
    'been sent to a forced-labour camp. As for',
    'his sister, she might have been removed,',
    'like Winston himself, to one of the colonies',
    'for homeless children (Reclamation Centres,',
    'they were called) which had grown up as a',
    'result of the civil war, or she might have',
    'been sent to the labour camp along with his',
    'mother, or simply left somewhere or other',
    'to die. The dream was still vivid in his',
    'mind, especially the enveloping protecting',
    'gesture of the arm in which its whole meaning',
    'seemed to be contained. His mind went back',
    'to another dream of two months ago. Exactly',
    'as his mother had sat on the dingy white-quilted',
    'bed, with the child clinging to her, so she',
    'had sat in the sunken ship, far underneath',
    'him, and drowning deeper every minute, but',
    'still looking up at him through the darkening',
    'water. He told Julia the story of his mother\'s',
    'disappearance. Without opening her eyes she',
    'rolled over and settled herself into a more',
    'comfortable position. \'I expect you were',
    'a beastly little swine in those days,\' she',
    'said indistinctly. \'All children are swine.\'',
    '\'Yes. But the real point of the story, ,',
    '\' From her breathing it was evident that',
    'she was going off to sleep again. He would',
    'have liked to continue talking about his',
    'mother. He did not suppose, from what he',
    'could remember of her, that she had been',
    'an unusual woman, still less an intelligent',
    'one; and yet she had possessed a kind of',
    'nobility, a kind of purity, simply because',
    'the standards that she obeyed were private',
    'ones. Her feelings were her own, and could',
    'not be altered from outside. It would not',
    'have occurred to her that an action which',
    'is ineffectual thereby becomes meaningless.',
    'If you loved someone, you loved him, and',
    'when you had nothing else to give, you still',
    'gave him love. When the last of the chocolate',
    'was gone, his mother had clasped the child',
    'in her arms. It was no use, it changed nothing,',
    'it did not produce more chocolate, it did',
    'not avert the child\'s death or her own; but',
    'it seemed natural to her to do it. The refugee',
    'woman in the boat had also covered the little',
    'boy with her arm, which was no more use against',
    'the bullets than a sheet of paper. The terrible',
    'thing that the Party had done was to persuade',
    'you that mere impulses, mere feelings, were',
    'of no account, while at the same time robbing',
    'you of all power over the material world.',
    'When once you were in the grip of the Party,',
    'what you felt or did not feel, what you did',
    'or refrained from doing, made literally no',
    'difference. Whatever happened you vanished,',
    'and neither you nor your actions were ever',
    'heard of again. You were lifted clean out',
    'of the stream of history. And yet to the',
    'people of only two generations ago this would',
    'not have seemed all-important, because they',
    'were not attempting to alter history. They',
    'were governed by private loyalties which',
    'they did not question. What mattered were',
    'individual relationships, and a completely',
    'helpless gesture, an embrace, a tear, a word',
    'spoken to a dying man, could have value in',
    'itself. The proles, it suddenly occurred',
    'to him, had remained in this condition. They',
    'were not loyal to a party or a country or',
    'an idea, they were loyal to one another.',
    'For the first time in his life he did not',
    'despise the proles or think of them merely',
    'as an inert force which would one day spring',
    'to life and regenerate the world. The proles',
    'had stayed human. They had not become hardened',
    'inside. They had held on to the primitive',
    'emotions which he himself had to re-learn',
    'by conscious effort. And in thinking this',
    'he remembered, without apparent relevance,',
    'how a few weeks ago he had seen a severed',
    'hand lying on the pavement and had kicked',
    'it into the gutter as though it had been',
    'a cabbage-stalk. \'The proles are human beings,\'',
    'he said aloud. \'We are not human.\' \'Why not?\'',
    'said Julia, who had woken up again. He thought',
    'for a little while. \'Has it ever occurred',
    'to you,\' he said, \'that the best thing for',
    'us to do would be simply to walk out of here',
    'before it\'s too late, and never see each',
    'other again?\' \'Yes, dear, it has occurred',
    'to me, several times. But I\'m not going to',
    'do it, all the same.\' \'We\'ve been lucky,\'',
    'he said \'but it can\'t last much longer. You\'re',
    'young. You look normal and innocent. If you',
    'keep clear of people like me, you might stay',
    'alive for another fifty years.\' \'No. I\'ve',
    'thought it all out. What you do, I\'m going',
    'to do. And don\'t be too downhearted. I\'m',
    'rather good at staying alive.\' \'We may be',
    'together for another six months, a year,',
    'there\'s no knowing. At the end we\'re certain',
    'to be apart. Do you realize how utterly alone',
    'we shall be? When once they get hold of us',
    'there will be nothing, literally nothing,',
    'that either of us can do for the other. If',
    'I confess, they\'ll shoot you, and if I refuse',
    'to confess, they\'ll shoot you just the same.',
    'Nothing that I can do or say, or stop myself',
    'from saying, will put off your death for',
    'as much as five minutes. Neither of us will',
    'even know whether the other is alive or dead.',
    'We shall be utterly without power of any',
    'kind. The one thing that matters is that',
    'we shouldn\'t betray one another, although',
    'even that can\'t make the slightest difference.\'',
    '\'If you mean confessing,\' she said, \'we shall',
    'do that, right enough. Everybody always confesses.',
    'You can\'t help it. They torture you.\' \'I',
    'don\'t mean confessing. Confession is not',
    'betrayal. What you say or do doesn\'t matter:',
    'only feelings matter. If they could make',
    'me stop loving you, that would be the real',
    'betrayal.\' She thought it over. \'They can\'t',
    'do that,\' she said finally. \'It\'s the one',
    'thing they can\'t do. They can make you say',
    'anything, ANYTHING, but they can\'t make you',
    'believe it. They can\'t get inside you.\' \'No,\'',
    'he said a little more hopefully, \'no; that\'s',
    'quite true. They can\'t get inside you. If',
    'you can FEEL that staying human is worth',
    'while, even when it can\'t have any result',
    'whatever, you\'ve beaten them.\' He thought',
    'of the telescreen with its never-sleeping',
    'ear. They could spy upon you night and day,',
    'but if you kept your head you could still',
    'outwit them. With all their cleverness they',
    'had never mastered the secret of finding',
    'out what another human being was thinking.',
    'Perhaps that was less true when you were',
    'actually in their hands. One did not know',
    'what happened inside the Ministry of Love,',
    'but it was possible to guess: tortures, drugs,',
    'delicate instruments that registered your',
    'nervous reactions, gradual wearing-down by',
    'sleeplessness and solitude and persistent',
    'questioning. Facts, at any rate, could not',
    'be kept hidden. They could be tracked down',
    'by enquiry, they could be squeezed out of',
    'you by torture. But if the object was not',
    'to stay alive but to stay human, what difference',
    'did it ultimately make? They could not alter',
    'your feelings: for that matter you could',
    'not alter them yourself, even if you wanted',
    'to. They could lay bare in the utmost detail',
    'everything that you had done or said or thought;',
    'but the inner heart, whose workings were',
    'mysterious even to yourself, remained impregnable.',
    'Chapter 8 They had done it, they had done',
    'it at last! The room they were standing in',
    'was long-shaped and softly lit. The telescreen',
    'was dimmed to a low murmur; the richness',
    'of the dark-blue carpet gave one the impression',
    'of treading on velvet. At the far end of',
    'the room O\'Brien was sitting at a table under',
    'a green-shaded lamp, with a mass of papers',
    'on either side of him. He had not bothered',
    'to look up when the servant showed Julia',
    'and Winston in. Winston\'s heart was thumping',
    'so hard that he doubted whether he would',
    'be able to speak. They had done it, they',
    'had done it at last, was all he could think.',
    'It had been a rash act to come here at all,',
    'and sheer folly to arrive together; though',
    'it was true that they had come by different',
    'routes and only met on O\'Brien\'s doorstep.',
    'But merely to walk into such a place needed',
    'an effort of the nerve. It was only on very',
    'rare occasions that one saw inside the dwelling-places',
    'of the Inner Party, or even penetrated into',
    'the quarter of the town where they lived.',
    'The whole atmosphere of the huge block of',
    'flats, the richness and spaciousness of everything,',
    'the unfamiliar smells of good food and good',
    'tobacco, the silent and incredibly rapid',
    'lifts sliding up and down, the white-jacketed',
    'servants hurrying to and fro, everything',
    'was intimidating. Although he had a good',
    'pretext for coming here, he was haunted at',
    'every step by the fear that a black-uniformed',
    'guard would suddenly appear from round the',
    'corner, demand his papers, and order him',
    'to get out. O\'Brien\'s servant, however, had',
    'admitted the two of them without demur. He',
    'was a small, dark-haired man in a white jacket,',
    'with a diamond-shaped, completely expressionless',
    'face which might have been that of a Chinese.',
    'The passage down which he led them was softly',
    'carpeted, with cream-papered walls and white',
    'wainscoting, all exquisitely clean. That',
    'too was intimidating. Winston could not remember',
    'ever to have seen a passageway whose walls',
    'were not grimy from the contact of human',
    'bodies. O\'Brien had a slip of paper between',
    'his fingers and seemed to be studying it',
    'intently. His heavy face, bent down so that',
    'one could see the line of the nose, looked',
    'both formidable and intelligent. For perhaps',
    'twenty seconds he sat without stirring. Then',
    'he pulled the speakwrite towards him and',
    'rapped out a message in the hybrid jargon',
    'of the Ministries: \'Items one comma five',
    'comma seven approved fullwise stop suggestion',
    'contained item six doubleplus ridiculous',
    'verging crimethink cancel stop unproceed',
    'constructionwise antegetting plusfull estimates',
    'machinery overheads stop end message.\' He',
    'rose deliberately from his chair and came',
    'towards them across the soundless carpet.',
    'A little of the official atmosphere seemed',
    'to have fallen away from him with the Newspeak',
    'words, but his expression was grimmer than',
    'usual, as though he were not pleased at being',
    'disturbed. The terror that Winston already',
    'felt was suddenly shot through by a streak',
    'of ordinary embarrassment. It seemed to him',
    'quite possible that he had simply made a',
    'stupid mistake. For what evidence had he',
    'in reality that O\'Brien was any kind of political',
    'conspirator? Nothing but a flash of the eyes',
    'and a single equivocal remark: beyond that,',
    'only his own secret imaginings, founded on',
    'a dream. He could not even fall back on the',
    'pretence that he had come to borrow the dictionary,',
    'because in that case Julia\'s presence was',
    'impossible to explain. As O\'Brien passed',
    'the telescreen a thought seemed to strike',
    'him. He stopped, turned aside and pressed',
    'a switch on the wall. There was a sharp snap.',
    'The voice had stopped. Julia uttered a tiny',
    'sound, a sort of squeak of surprise. Even',
    'in the midst of his panic, Winston was too',
    'much taken aback to be able to hold his tongue.',
    '\'You can turn it off!\' he said. \'Yes,\' said',
    'O\'Brien, \'we can turn it off. We have that',
    'privilege.\' He was opposite them now. His',
    'solid form towered over the pair of them,',
    'and the expression on his face was still',
    'indecipherable. He was waiting, somewhat',
    'sternly, for Winston to speak, but about',
    'what? Even now it was quite conceivable that',
    'he was simply a busy man wondering irritably',
    'why he had been interrupted. Nobody spoke.',
    'After the stopping of the telescreen the',
    'room seemed deadly silent. The seconds marched',
    'past, enormous. With difficulty Winston continued',
    'to keep his eyes fixed on O\'Brien\'s. Then',
    'suddenly the grim face broke down into what',
    'might have been the beginnings of a smile.',
    'With his characteristic gesture O\'Brien resettled',
    'his spectacles on his nose. \'Shall I say',
    'it, or will you?\' he said. \'I will say it,\'',
    'said Winston promptly. \'That thing is really',
    'turned off?\' \'Yes, everything is turned off.',
    'We are alone.\' \'We have come here because,',
    ', \' He paused, realizing for the first time',
    'the vagueness of his own motives. Since he',
    'did not in fact know what kind of help he',
    'expected from O\'Brien, it was not easy to',
    'say why he had come here. He went on, conscious',
    'that what he was saying must sound both feeble',
    'and pretentious: \'We believe that there is',
    'some kind of conspiracy, some kind of secret',
    'organization working against the Party, and',
    'that you are involved in it. We want to join',
    'it and work for it. We are enemies of the',
    'Party. We disbelieve in the principles of',
    'Ingsoc. We are thought-criminals. We are',
    'also adulterers. I tell you this because',
    'we want to put ourselves at your mercy. If',
    'you want us to incriminate ourselves in any',
    'other way, we are ready.\' He stopped and',
    'glanced over his shoulder, with the feeling',
    'that the door had opened. Sure enough, the',
    'little yellow-faced servant had come in without',
    'knocking. Winston saw that he was carrying',
    'a tray with a decanter and glasses. \'Martin',
    'is one of us,\' said O\'Brien impassively.',
    '\'Bring the drinks over here, Martin. Put',
    'them on the round table. Have we enough chairs?',
    'Then we may as well sit down and talk in',
    'comfort. Bring a chair for yourself, Martin.',
    'This is business. You can stop being a servant',
    'for the next ten minutes.\' The little man',
    'sat down, quite at his ease, and yet still',
    'with a servant-like air, the air of a valet',
    'enjoying a privilege. Winston regarded him',
    'out of the corner of his eye. It struck him',
    'that the man\'s whole life was playing a part,',
    'and that he felt it to be dangerous to drop',
    'his assumed personality even for a moment.',
    'O\'Brien took the decanter by the neck and',
    'filled up the glasses with a dark-red liquid.',
    'It aroused in Winston dim memories of something',
    'seen long ago on a wall or a hoarding, a',
    'vast bottle composed of electric lights which',
    'seemed to move up and down and pour its contents',
    'into a glass. Seen from the top the stuff',
    'looked almost black, but in the decanter',
    'it gleamed like a ruby. It had a sour-sweet',
    'smell. He saw Julia pick up her glass and',
    'sniff at it with frank curiosity. \'It is',
    'called wine,\' said O\'Brien with a faint smile.',
    '\'You will have read about it in books, no',
    'doubt. Not much of it gets to the Outer Party,',
    'I am afraid.\' His face grew solemn again,',
    'and he raised his glass: \'I think it is fitting',
    'that we should begin by drinking a health.',
    'To our Leader: To Emmanuel Goldstein.\' Winston',
    'took up his glass with a certain eagerness.',
    'Wine was a thing he had read and dreamed',
    'about. Like the glass paperweight or Mr Charrington\'s',
    'half-remembered rhymes, it belonged to the',
    'vanished, romantic past, the olden time as',
    'he liked to call it in his secret thoughts.',
    'For some reason he had always thought of',
    'wine as having an intensely sweet taste,',
    'like that of blackberry jam and an immediate',
    'intoxicating effect. Actually, when he came',
    'to swallow it, the stuff was distinctly disappointing.',
    'The truth was that after years of gin-drinking',
    'he could barely taste it. He set down the',
    'empty glass. \'Then there is such a person',
    'as Goldstein?\' he said. \'Yes, there is such',
    'a person, and he is alive. Where, I do not',
    'know.\' \'And the conspiracy, the organization?',
    'Is it real? It is not simply an invention',
    'of the Thought Police?\' \'No, it is real.',
    'The Brotherhood, we call it. You will never',
    'learn much more about the Brotherhood than',
    'that it exists and that you belong to it.',
    'I will come back to that presently.\' He looked',
    'at his wrist-watch. \'It is unwise even for',
    'members of the Inner Party to turn off the',
    'telescreen for more than half an hour. You',
    'ought not to have come here together, and',
    'you will have to leave separately. You, comrade\',',
    'he bowed his head to Julia, \'will leave first.',
    'We have about twenty minutes at our disposal.',
    'You will understand that I must start by',
    'asking you certain questions. In general',
    'terms, what are you prepared to do?\' \'Anything',
    'that we are capable of,\' said Winston. O\'Brien',
    'had turned himself a little in his chair',
    'so that he was facing Winston. He almost',
    'ignored Julia, seeming to take it for granted',
    'that Winston could speak for her. For a moment',
    'the lids flitted down over his eyes. He began',
    'asking his questions in a low, expressionless',
    'voice, as though this were a routine, a sort',
    'of catechism, most of whose answers were',
    'known to him already. \'You are prepared to',
    'give your lives?\' \'Yes.\' \'You are prepared',
    'to commit murder?\' \'Yes.\' \'To commit acts',
    'of sabotage which may cause the death of',
    'hundreds of innocent people?\' \'Yes.\' \'To',
    'betray your country to foreign powers?\' \'Yes.\'',
    '\'You are prepared to cheat, to forge, to',
    'blackmail, to corrupt the minds of children,',
    'to distribute habit-forming drugs, to encourage',
    'prostitution, to disseminate venereal diseases,',
    'to do anything which is likely to cause demoralization',
    'and weaken the power of the Party?\' \'Yes.\'',
    '\'If, for example, it would somehow serve',
    'our interests to throw sulphuric acid in',
    'a child\'s face, are you prepared to do that?\'',
    '\'Yes.\' \'You are prepared to lose your identity',
    'and live out the rest of your life as a waiter',
    'or a dock-worker?\' \'Yes.\' \'You are prepared',
    'to commit suicide, if and when we order you',
    'to do so?\' \'Yes.\' \'You are prepared, the',
    'two of you, to separate and never see one',
    'another again?\' \'No!\' broke in Julia. It',
    'appeared to Winston that a long time passed',
    'before he answered. For a moment he seemed',
    'even to have been deprived of the power of',
    'speech. His tongue worked soundlessly, forming',
    'the opening syllables first of one word,',
    'then of the other, over and over again. Until',
    'he had said it, he did not know which word',
    'he was going to say. \'No,\' he said finally.',
    '\'You did well to tell me,\' said O\'Brien.',
    '\'It is necessary for us to know everything.\'',
    'He turned himself toward Julia and added',
    'in a voice with somewhat more expression',
    'in it: \'Do you understand that even if he',
    'survives, it may be as a different person?',
    'We may be obliged to give him a new identity.',
    'His face, his movements, the shape of his',
    'hands, the colour of his hair, even his voice',
    'would be different. And you yourself might',
    'have become a different person. Our surgeons',
    'can alter people beyond recognition. Sometimes',
    'it is necessary. Sometimes we even amputate',
    'a limb.\' Winston could not help snatching',
    'another sidelong glance at Martin\'s Mongolian',
    'face. There were no scars that he could see.',
    'Julia had turned a shade paler, so that her',
    'freckles were showing, but she faced O\'Brien',
    'boldly. She murmured something that seemed',
    'to be assent. \'Good. Then that is settled.\'',
    'There was a silver box of cigarettes on the',
    'table. With a rather absent-minded air O\'Brien',
    'pushed them towards the others, took one',
    'himself, then stood up and began to pace',
    'slowly to and fro, as though he could think',
    'better standing. They were very good cigarettes,',
    'very thick and well-packed, with an unfamiliar',
    'silkiness in the paper. O\'Brien looked at',
    'his wrist-watch again. \'You had better go',
    'back to your Pantry, Martin,\' he said. \'I',
    'shall switch on in a quarter of an hour.',
    'Take a good look at these comrades\' faces',
    'before you go. You will be seeing them again.',
    'I may not.\' Exactly as they had done at the',
    'front door, the little man\'s dark eyes flickered',
    'over their faces. There was not a trace of',
    'friendliness in his manner. He was memorizing',
    'their appearance, but he felt no interest',
    'in them, or appeared to feel none. It occurred',
    'to Winston that a synthetic face was perhaps',
    'incapable of changing its expression. Without',
    'speaking or giving any kind of salutation,',
    'Martin went out, closing the door silently',
    'behind him. O\'Brien was strolling up and',
    'down, one hand in the pocket of his black',
    'overalls, the other holding his cigarette.',
    '\'You understand,\' he said, \'that you will',
    'be fighting in the dark. You will always',
    'be in the dark. You will receive orders and',
    'you will obey them, without knowing why.',
    'Later I shall send you a book from which',
    'you will learn the true nature of the society',
    'we live in, and the strategy by which we',
    'shall destroy it. When you have read the',
    'book, you will be full members of the Brotherhood.',
    'But between the general aims that we are',
    'fighting for and the immediate tasks of the',
    'moment, you will never know anything. I tell',
    'you that the Brotherhood exists, but I cannot',
    'tell you whether it numbers a hundred members,',
    'or ten million. From your personal knowledge',
    'you will never be able to say that it numbers',
    'even as many as a dozen. You will have three',
    'or four contacts, who will be renewed from',
    'time to time as they disappear. As this was',
    'your first contact, it will be preserved.',
    'When you receive orders, they will come from',
    'me. If we find it necessary to communicate',
    'with you, it will be through Martin. When',
    'you are finally caught, you will confess.',
    'That is unavoidable. But you will have very',
    'little to confess, other than your own actions.',
    'You will not be able to betray more than',
    'a handful of unimportant people. Probably',
    'you will not even betray me. By that time',
    'I may be dead, or I shall have become a different',
    'person, with a different face.\' He continued',
    'to move to and fro over the soft carpet.',
    'In spite of the bulkiness of his body there',
    'was a remarkable grace in his movements.',
    'It came out even in the gesture with which',
    'he thrust a hand into his pocket, or manipulated',
    'a cigarette. More even than of strength,',
    'he gave an impression of confidence and of',
    'an understanding tinged by irony. However',
    'much in earnest he might be, he had nothing',
    'of the single-mindedness that belongs to',
    'a fanatic. When he spoke of murder, suicide,',
    'venereal disease, amputated limbs, and altered',
    'faces, it was with a faint air of persiflage.',
    '\'This is unavoidable,\' his voice seemed to',
    'say; \'this is what we have got to do, unflinchingly.',
    'But this is not what we shall be doing when',
    'life is worth living again.\' A wave of admiration,',
    'almost of worship, flowed out from Winston',
    'towards O\'Brien. For the moment he had forgotten',
    'the shadowy figure of Goldstein. When you',
    'looked at O\'Brien\'s powerful shoulders and',
    'his blunt-featured face, so ugly and yet',
    'so civilized, it was impossible to believe',
    'that he could be defeated. There was no stratagem',
    'that he was not equal to, no danger that',
    'he could not foresee. Even Julia seemed to',
    'be impressed. She had let her cigarette go',
    'out and was listening intently. O\'Brien went',
    'on: \'You will have heard rumours of the existence',
    'of the Brotherhood. No doubt you have formed',
    'your own picture of it. You have imagined,',
    'probably, a huge underworld of conspirators,',
    'meeting secretly in cellars, scribbling messages',
    'on walls, recognizing one another by codewords',
    'or by special movements of the hand. Nothing',
    'of the kind exists. The members of the Brotherhood',
    'have no way of recognizing one another, and',
    'it is impossible for any one member to be',
    'aware of the identity of more than a few',
    'others. Goldstein himself, if he fell into',
    'the hands of the Thought Police, could not',
    'give them a complete list of members, or',
    'any information that would lead them to a',
    'complete list. No such list exists. The Brotherhood',
    'cannot be wiped out because it is not an',
    'organization in the ordinary sense. Nothing',
    'holds it together except an idea which is',
    'indestructible. You will never have anything',
    'to sustain you, except the idea. You will',
    'get no comradeship and no encouragement.',
    'When finally you are caught, you will get',
    'no help. We never help our members. At most,',
    'when it is absolutely necessary that someone',
    'should be silenced, we are occasionally able',
    'to smuggle a razor blade into a prisoner\'s',
    'cell. You will have to get used to living',
    'without results and without hope. You will',
    'work for a while, you will be caught, you',
    'will confess, and then you will die. Those',
    'are the only results that you will ever see.',
    'There is no possibility that any perceptible',
    'change will happen within our own lifetime.',
    'We are the dead. Our only true life is in',
    'the future. We shall take part in it as handfuls',
    'of dust and splinters of bone. But how far',
    'away that future may be, there is no knowing.',
    'It might be a thousand years. At present',
    'nothing is possible except to extend the',
    'area of sanity little by little. We cannot',
    'act collectively. We can only spread our',
    'knowledge outwards from individual to individual,',
    'generation after generation. In the face',
    'of the Thought Police there is no other way.\'',
    'He halted and looked for the third time at',
    'his wrist-watch. \'It is almost time for you',
    'to leave, comrade,\' he said to Julia. \'Wait.',
    'The decanter is still half full.\' He filled',
    'the glasses and raised his own glass by the',
    'stem. \'What shall it be this time?\' he said,',
    'still with the same faint suggestion of irony.',
    '\'To the confusion of the Thought Police?',
    'To the death of Big Brother? To humanity?',
    'To the future?\' \'To the past,\' said Winston.',
    '\'The past is more important,\' agreed O\'Brien',
    'gravely. They emptied their glasses, and',
    'a moment later Julia stood up to go. O\'Brien',
    'took a small box from the top of a cabinet',
    'and handed her a flat white tablet which',
    'he told her to place on her tongue. It was',
    'important, he said, not to go out smelling',
    'of wine: the lift attendants were very observant.',
    'As soon as the door had shut behind her he',
    'appeared to forget her existence. He took',
    'another pace or two up and down, then stopped.',
    '\'There are details to be settled,\' he said.',
    '\'I assume that you have a hiding-place of',
    'some kind?\' Winston explained about the room',
    'over Mr Charrington\'s shop. \'That will do',
    'for the moment. Later we will arrange something',
    'else for you. It is important to change one\'s',
    'hiding-place frequently. Meanwhile I shall',
    'send you a copy of THE BOOK\', even O\'Brien,',
    'Winston noticed, seemed to pronounce the',
    'words as though they were in italics, \'Goldstein\'s',
    'book, you understand, as soon as possible.',
    'It may be some days before I can get hold',
    'of one. There are not many in existence,',
    'as you can imagine. The Thought Police hunt',
    'them down and destroy them almost as fast',
    'as we can produce them. It makes very little',
    'difference. The book is indestructible. If',
    'the last copy were gone, we could reproduce',
    'it almost word for word. Do you carry a brief-case',
    'to work with you?\' he added. \'As a rule,',
    'yes.\' \'What is it like?\' \'Black, very shabby.',
    'With two straps.\' \'Black, two straps, very',
    'shabby, good. One day in the fairly near',
    'future, I cannot give a date, one of the',
    'messages among your morning\'s work will contain',
    'a misprinted word, and you will have to ask',
    'for a repeat. On the following day you will',
    'go to work without your brief-case. At some',
    'time during the day, in the street, a man',
    'will touch you on the arm and say "I think',
    'you have dropped your brief-case." The one',
    'he gives you will contain a copy of Goldstein\'s',
    'book. You will return it within fourteen',
    'days.\' They were silent for a moment. \'There',
    'are a couple of minutes before you need go,\'',
    'said O\'Brien. \'We shall meet again, if we',
    'do meet again, , \' Winston looked up at him.',
    '\'In the place where there is no darkness?\'',
    'he said hesitantly. O\'Brien nodded without',
    'appearance of surprise. \'In the place where',
    'there is no darkness,\' he said, as though',
    'he had recognized the allusion. \'And in the',
    'meantime, is there anything that you wish',
    'to say before you leave? Any message? Any',
    'question?.\' Winston thought. There did not',
    'seem to be any further question that he wanted',
    'to ask: still less did he feel any impulse',
    'to utter high-sounding generalities. Instead',
    'of anything directly connected with O\'Brien',
    'or the Brotherhood, there came into his mind',
    'a sort of composite picture of the dark bedroom',
    'where his mother had spent her last days,',
    'and the little room over Mr Charrington\'s',
    'shop, and the glass paperweight, and the',
    'steel engraving in its rosewood frame. Almost',
    'at random he said: \'Did you ever happen to',
    'hear an old rhyme that begins "Oranges and',
    'lemons, say the bells of St Clement\'s"?\'',
    'Again O\'Brien nodded. With a sort of grave',
    'courtesy he completed the stanza: \'Oranges',
    'and lemons, say the bells of St Clement\'s,',
    'You owe me three farthings, say the bells',
    'of St Martin\'s, When will you pay me? say',
    'the bells of Old Bailey, When I grow rich,',
    'say the bells of Shoreditch.\' \'You knew the',
    'last line!\' said Winston. \'Yes, I knew the',
    'last line. And now, I am afraid, it is time',
    'for you to go. But wait. You had better let',
    'me give you one of these tablets.\' As Winston',
    'stood up O\'Brien held out a hand. His powerful',
    'grip crushed the bones of Winston\'s palm.',
    'At the door Winston looked back, but O\'Brien',
    'seemed already to be in process of putting',
    'him out of mind. He was waiting with his',
    'hand on the switch that controlled the telescreen.',
    'Beyond him Winston could see the writing-table',
    'with its green-shaded lamp and the speakwrite',
    'and the wire baskets deep-laden with papers.',
    'The incident was closed. Within thirty seconds,',
    'it occurred to him, O\'Brien would be back',
    'at his interrupted and important work on',
    'behalf of the Party. Chapter 9 Winston was',
    'gelatinous with fatigue. Gelatinous was the',
    'right word. It had come into his head spontaneously.',
    'His body seemed to have not only the weakness',
    'of a jelly, but its translucency. He felt',
    'that if he held up his hand he would be able',
    'to see the light through it. All the blood',
    'and lymph had been drained out of him by',
    'an enormous debauch of work, leaving only',
    'a frail structure of nerves, bones, and skin.',
    'All sensations seemed to be magnified. His',
    'overalls fretted his shoulders, the pavement',
    'tickled his feet, even the opening and closing',
    'of a hand was an effort that made his joints',
    'creak. He had worked more than ninety hours',
    'in five days. So had everyone else in the',
    'Ministry. Now it was all over, and he had',
    'literally nothing to do, no Party work of',
    'any description, until tomorrow morning.',
    'He could spend six hours in the hiding-place',
    'and another nine in his own bed. Slowly,',
    'in mild afternoon sunshine, he walked up',
    'a dingy street in the direction of Mr Charrington\'s',
    'shop, keeping one eye open for the patrols,',
    'but irrationally convinced that this afternoon',
    'there was no danger of anyone interfering',
    'with him. The heavy brief-case that he was',
    'carrying bumped against his knee at each',
    'step, sending a tingling sensation up and',
    'down the skin of his leg. Inside it was the',
    'book, which he had now had in his possession',
    'for six days and had not yet opened, nor',
    'even looked at. On the sixth day of Hate',
    'Week, after the processions, the speeches,',
    'the shouting, the singing, the banners, the',
    'posters, the films, the waxworks, the rolling',
    'of drums and squealing of trumpets, the tramp',
    'of marching feet, the grinding of the caterpillars',
    'of tanks, the roar of massed planes, the',
    'booming of guns, after six days of this,',
    'when the great orgasm was quivering to its',
    'climax and the general hatred of Eurasia',
    'had boiled up into such delirium that if',
    'the crowd could have got their hands on the',
    '2,000 Eurasian war-criminals who were to',
    'be publicly hanged on the last day of the',
    'proceedings, they would unquestionably have',
    'torn them to pieces, at just this moment',
    'it had been announced that Oceania was not',
    'after all at war with Eurasia. Oceania was',
    'at war with Eastasia. Eurasia was an ally.',
    'There was, of course, no admission that any',
    'change had taken place. Merely it became',
    'known, with extreme suddenness and everywhere',
    'at once, that Eastasia and not Eurasia was',
    'the enemy. Winston was taking part in a demonstration',
    'in one of the central London squares at the',
    'moment when it happened. It was night, and',
    'the white faces and the scarlet banners were',
    'luridly floodlit. The square was packed with',
    'several thousand people, including a block',
    'of about a thousand schoolchildren in the',
    'uniform of the Spies. On a scarlet-draped',
    'platform an orator of the Inner Party, a',
    'small lean man with disproportionately long',
    'arms and a large bald skull over which a',
    'few lank locks straggled, was haranguing',
    'the crowd. A little Rumpelstiltskin figure,',
    'contorted with hatred, he gripped the neck',
    'of the microphone with one hand while the',
    'other, enormous at the end of a bony arm,',
    'clawed the air menacingly above his head.',
    'His voice, made metallic by the amplifiers,',
    'boomed forth an endless catalogue of atrocities,',
    'massacres, deportations, lootings, rapings,',
    'torture of prisoners, bombing of civilians,',
    'lying propaganda, unjust aggressions, broken',
    'treaties. It was almost impossible to listen',
    'to him without being first convinced and',
    'then maddened. At every few moments the fury',
    'of the crowd boiled over and the voice of',
    'the speaker was drowned by a wild beast-like',
    'roaring that rose uncontrollably from thousands',
    'of throats. The most savage yells of all',
    'came from the schoolchildren. The speech',
    'had been proceeding for perhaps twenty minutes',
    'when a messenger hurried on to the platform',
    'and a scrap of paper was slipped into the',
    'speaker\'s hand. He unrolled and read it without',
    'pausing in his speech. Nothing altered in',
    'his voice or manner, or in the content of',
    'what he was saying, but suddenly the names',
    'were different. Without words said, a wave',
    'of understanding rippled through the crowd.',
    'Oceania was at war with Eastasia! The next',
    'moment there was a tremendous commotion.',
    'The banners and posters with which the square',
    'was decorated were all wrong! Quite half',
    'of them had the wrong faces on them. It was',
    'sabotage! The agents of Goldstein had been',
    'at work! There was a riotous interlude while',
    'posters were ripped from the walls, banners',
    'torn to shreds and trampled underfoot. The',
    'Spies performed prodigies of activity in',
    'clambering over the rooftops and cutting',
    'the streamers that fluttered from the chimneys.',
    'But within two or three minutes it was all',
    'over. The orator, still gripping the neck',
    'of the microphone, his shoulders hunched',
    'forward, his free hand clawing at the air,',
    'had gone straight on with his speech. One',
    'minute more, and the feral roars of rage',
    'were again bursting from the crowd. The Hate',
    'continued exactly as before, except that',
    'the target had been changed. The thing that',
    'impressed Winston in looking back was that',
    'the speaker had switched from one line to',
    'the other actually in midsentence, not only',
    'without a pause, but without even breaking',
    'the syntax. But at the moment he had other',
    'things to preoccupy him. It was during the',
    'moment of disorder while the posters were',
    'being torn down that a man whose face he',
    'did not see had tapped him on the shoulder',
    'and said, \'Excuse me, I think you\'ve dropped',
    'your brief-case.\' He took the brief-case',
    'abstractedly, without speaking. He knew that',
    'it would be days before he had an opportunity',
    'to look inside it. The instant that the demonstration',
    'was over he went straight to the Ministry',
    'of Truth, though the time was now nearly',
    'twenty-three hours. The entire staff of the',
    'Ministry had done likewise. The orders already',
    'issuing from the telescreen, recalling them',
    'to their posts, were hardly necessary. Oceania',
    'was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always',
    'been at war with Eastasia. A large part of',
    'the political literature of five years was',
    'now completely obsolete. Reports and records',
    'of all kinds, newspapers, books, pamphlets,',
    'films, sound-tracks, photographs, all had',
    'to be rectified at lightning speed. Although',
    'no directive was ever issued, it was known',
    'that the chiefs of the Department intended',
    'that within one week no reference to the',
    'war with Eurasia, or the alliance with Eastasia,',
    'should remain in existence anywhere. The',
    'work was overwhelming, all the more so because',
    'the processes that it involved could not',
    'be called by their true names. Everyone in',
    'the Records Department worked eighteen hours',
    'in the twenty-four, with two three-hour snatches',
    'of sleep. Mattresses were brought up from',
    'the cellars and pitched all over the corridors:',
    'meals consisted of sandwiches and Victory',
    'Coffee wheeled round on trolleys by attendants',
    'from the canteen. Each time that Winston',
    'broke off for one of his spells of sleep',
    'he tried to leave his desk clear of work,',
    'and each time that he crawled back sticky-eyed',
    'and aching, it was to find that another shower',
    'of paper cylinders had covered the desk like',
    'a snowdrift, half-burying the speakwrite',
    'and overflowing on to the floor, so that',
    'the first job was always to stack them into',
    'a neat enough pile to give him room to work.',
    'What was worst of all was that the work was',
    'by no means purely mechanical. Often it was',
    'enough merely to substitute one name for',
    'another, but any detailed report of events',
    'demanded care and imagination. Even the geographical',
    'knowledge that one needed in transferring',
    'the war from one part of the world to another',
    'was considerable. By the third day his eyes',
    'ached unbearably and his spectacles needed',
    'wiping every few minutes. It was like struggling',
    'with some crushing physical task, something',
    'which one had the right to refuse and which',
    'one was nevertheless neurotically anxious',
    'to accomplish. In so far as he had time to',
    'remember it, he was not troubled by the fact',
    'that every word he murmured into the speakwrite,',
    'every stroke of his ink-pencil, was a deliberate',
    'lie. He was as anxious as anyone else in',
    'the Department that the forgery should be',
    'perfect. On the morning of the sixth day',
    'the dribble of cylinders slowed down. For',
    'as much as half an hour nothing came out',
    'of the tube; then one more cylinder, then',
    'nothing. Everywhere at about the same time',
    'the work was easing off. A deep and as it',
    'were secret sigh went through the Department.',
    'A mighty deed, which could never be mentioned,',
    'had been achieved. It was now impossible',
    'for any human being to prove by documentary',
    'evidence that the war with Eurasia had ever',
    'happened. At twelve hundred it was unexpectedly',
    'announced that all workers in the Ministry',
    'were free till tomorrow morning. Winston,',
    'still carrying the brief-case containing',
    'the book, which had remained between his',
    'feet while he worked and under his body while',
    'he slept, went home, shaved himself, and',
    'almost fell asleep in his bath, although',
    'the water was barely more than tepid. With',
    'a sort of voluptuous creaking in his joints',
    'he climbed the stair above Mr Charrington\'s',
    'shop. He was tired, but not sleepy any longer.',
    'He opened the window, lit the dirty little',
    'oilstove and put on a pan of water for coffee.',
    'Julia would arrive presently: meanwhile there',
    'was the book. He sat down in the sluttish',
    'armchair and undid the straps of the brief-case.',
    'A heavy black volume, amateurishly bound,',
    'with no name or title on the cover. The print',
    'also looked slightly irregular. The pages',
    'were worn at the edges, and fell apart, easily,',
    'as though the book had passed through many',
    'hands. The inscription on the title-page',
    'ran: THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF OLIGARCHICAL',
    'COLLECTIVISM by Emmanuel Goldstein Winston',
    'began reading: Chapter I Ignorance is Strength',
    'Throughout recorded time, and probably since',
    'the end of the Neolithic Age, there have',
    'been three kinds of people in the world,',
    'the High, the Middle, and the Low. They have',
    'been subdivided in many ways, they have borne',
    'countless different names, and their relative',
    'numbers, as well as their attitude towards',
    'one another, have varied from age to age:',
    'but the essential structure of society has',
    'never altered. Even after enormous upheavals',
    'and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same',
    'pattern has always reasserted itself, just',
    'as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium,',
    'however far it is pushed one way or the other.',
    'The aims of these groups are entirely irreconcilable.',
    'Winston stopped reading, chiefly in order',
    'to appreciate the fact that he was reading,',
    'in comfort and safety. He was alone: no telescreen,',
    'no ear at the keyhole, no nervous impulse',
    'to glance over his shoulder or cover the',
    'page with his hand. The sweet summer air',
    'played against his cheek. From somewhere',
    'far away there floated the faint shouts of',
    'children: in the room itself there was no',
    'sound except the insect voice of the clock.',
    'He settled deeper into the arm-chair and',
    'put his feet up on the fender. It was bliss,',
    'it was eternity. Suddenly, as one sometimes',
    'does with a book of which one knows that',
    'one will ultimately read and re-read every',
    'word, he opened it at a different place and',
    'found himself at Chapter III. He went on',
    'reading: Chapter III War is Peace The splitting',
    'up of the world into three great super-states',
    'was an event which could be and indeed was',
    'foreseen before the middle of the twentieth',
    'century. With the absorption of Europe by',
    'Russia and of the British Empire by the United',
    'States, two of the three existing powers,',
    'Eurasia and Oceania, were already effectively',
    'in being. The third, Eastasia, only emerged',
    'as a distinct unit after another decade of',
    'confused fighting. The frontiers between',
    'the three super-states are in some places',
    'arbitrary, and in others they fluctuate according',
    'to the fortunes of war, but in general they',
    'follow geographical lines. Eurasia comprises',
    'the whole of the northern part of the European',
    'and Asiatic land-mass, from Portugal to the',
    'Bering Strait. Oceania comprises the Americas,',
    'the Atlantic islands including the British',
    'Isles, Australasia, and the southern portion',
    'of Africa. Eastasia, smaller than the others',
    'and with a less definite western frontier,',
    'comprises China and the countries to the',
    'south of it, the Japanese islands and a large',
    'but fluctuating portion of Manchuria, Mongolia,',
    'and Tibet. In one combination or another,',
    'these three super-states are permanently',
    'at war, and have been so for the past twenty-five',
    'years. War, however, is no longer the desperate,',
    'annihilating struggle that it was in the',
    'early decades of the twentieth century. It',
    'is a warfare of limited aims between combatants',
    'who are unable to destroy one another, have',
    'no material cause for fighting and are not',
    'divided by any genuine ideological difference.',
    'This is not to say that either the conduct',
    'of war, or the prevailing attitude towards',
    'it, has become less bloodthirsty or more',
    'chivalrous. On the contrary, war hysteria',
    'is continuous and universal in all countries,',
    'and such acts as raping, looting, the slaughter',
    'of children, the reduction of whole populations',
    'to slavery, and reprisals against prisoners',
    'which extend even to boiling and burying',
    'alive, are looked upon as normal, and, when',
    'they are committed by one\'s own side and',
    'not by the enemy, meritorious. But in a physical',
    'sense war involves very small numbers of',
    'people, mostly highly-trained specialists,',
    'and causes comparatively few casualties.',
    'The fighting, when there is any, takes place',
    'on the vague frontiers whose whereabouts',
    'the average man can only guess at, or round',
    'the Floating Fortresses which guard strategic',
    'spots on the sea lanes. In the centres of',
    'civilization war means no more than a continuous',
    'shortage of consumption goods, and the occasional',
    'crash of a rocket bomb which may cause a',
    'few scores of deaths. War has in fact changed',
    'its character. More exactly, the reasons',
    'for which war is waged have changed in their',
    'order of importance. Motives which were already',
    'present to some small extent in the great',
    'wars of the early twentieth century have',
    'now become dominant and are consciously recognized',
    'and acted upon. To understand the nature',
    'of the present war, for in spite of the regrouping',
    'which occurs every few years, it is always',
    'the same war, one must realize in the first',
    'place that it is impossible for it to be',
    'decisive. None of the three super-states',
    'could be definitively conquered even by the',
    'other two in combination. They are too evenly',
    'matched, and their natural defences are too',
    'formidable. Eurasia is protected by its vast',
    'land spaces, Oceania by the width of the',
    'Atlantic and the Pacific, Eastasia by the',
    'fecundity and industriousness of its inhabitants.',
    'Secondly, there is no longer, in a material',
    'sense, anything to fight about. With the',
    'establishment of self-contained economies,',
    'in which production and consumption are geared',
    'to one another, the scramble for markets',
    'which was a main cause of previous wars has',
    'come to an end, while the competition for',
    'raw materials is no longer a matter of life',
    'and death. In any case each of the three',
    'super-states is so vast that it can obtain',
    'almost all the materials that it needs within',
    'its own boundaries. In so far as the war',
    'has a direct economic purpose, it is a war',
    'for labour power. Between the frontiers of',
    'the super-states, and not permanently in',
    'the possession of any of them, there lies',
    'a rough quadrilateral with its corners at',
    'Tangier, Brazzaville, Darwin, and Hong Kong,',
    'containing within it about a fifth of the',
    'population of the earth. It is for the possession',
    'of these thickly-populated regions, and of',
    'the northern ice-cap, that the three powers',
    'are constantly struggling. In practice no',
    'one power ever controls the whole of the',
    'disputed area. Portions of it are constantly',
    'changing hands, and it is the chance of seizing',
    'this or that fragment by a sudden stroke',
    'of treachery that dictates the endless changes',
    'of alignment. All of the disputed territories',
    'contain valuable minerals, and some of them',
    'yield important vegetable products such as',
    'rubber which in colder climates it is necessary',
    'to synthesize by comparatively expensive',
    'methods. But above all they contain a bottomless',
    'reserve of cheap labour. Whichever power',
    'controls equatorial Africa, or the countries',
    'of the Middle East, or Southern India, or',
    'the Indonesian Archipelago, disposes also',
    'of the bodies of scores or hundreds of millions',
    'of ill-paid and hard-working coolies. The',
    'inhabitants of these areas, reduced more',
    'or less openly to the status of slaves, pass',
    'continually from conqueror to conqueror,',
    'and are expended like so much coal or oil',
    'in the race to turn out more armaments, to',
    'capture more territory, to control more labour',
    'power, to turn out more armaments, to capture',
    'more territory, and so on indefinitely. It',
    'should be noted that the fighting never really',
    'moves beyond the edges of the disputed areas.',
    'The frontiers of Eurasia flow back and forth',
    'between the basin of the Congo and the northern',
    'shore of the Mediterranean; the islands of',
    'the Indian Ocean and the Pacific are constantly',
    'being captured and recaptured by Oceania',
    'or by Eastasia; in Mongolia the dividing',
    'line between Eurasia and Eastasia is never',
    'stable; round the Pole all three powers lay',
    'claim to enormous territories which in fact',
    'are largely uninhabited and unexplored: but',
    'the balance of power always remains roughly',
    'even, and the territory which forms the heartland',
    'of each super-state always remains inviolate.',
    'Moreover, the labour of the exploited peoples',
    'round the Equator is not really necessary',
    'to the world\'s economy. They add nothing',
    'to the wealth of the world, since whatever',
    'they produce is used for purposes of war,',
    'and the object of waging a war is always',
    'to be in a better position in which to wage',
    'another war. By their labour the slave populations',
    'allow the tempo of continuous warfare to',
    'be speeded up. But if they did not exist,',
    'the structure of world society, and the process',
    'by which it maintains itself, would not be',
    'essentially different. The primary aim of',
    'modern warfare (in accordance with the principles',
    'of DOUBLETHINK, this aim is simultaneously',
    'recognized and not recognized by the directing',
    'brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the',
    'products of the machine without raising the',
    'general standard of living. Ever since the',
    'end of the nineteenth century, the problem',
    'of what to do with the surplus of consumption',
    'goods has been latent in industrial society.',
    'At present, when few human beings even have',
    'enough to eat, this problem is obviously',
    'not urgent, and it might not have become',
    'so, even if no artificial processes of destruction',
    'had been at work. The world of today is a',
    'bare, hungry, dilapidated place compared',
    'with the world that existed before 1914,',
    'and still more so if compared with the imaginary',
    'future to which the people of that period',
    'looked forward. In the early twentieth century,',
    'the vision of a future society unbelievably',
    'rich, leisured, orderly, and efficient, a',
    'glittering antiseptic world of glass and',
    'steel and snow-white concrete, was part of',
    'the consciousness of nearly every literate',
    'person. Science and technology were developing',
    'at a prodigious speed, and it seemed natural',
    'to assume that they would go on developing.',
    'This failed to happen, partly because of',
    'the impoverishment caused by a long series',
    'of wars and revolutions, partly because scientific',
    'and technical progress depended on the empirical',
    'habit of thought, which could not survive',
    'in a strictly regimented society. As a whole',
    'the world is more primitive today than it',
    'was fifty years ago. Certain backward areas',
    'have advanced, and various devices, always',
    'in some way connected with warfare and police',
    'espionage, have been developed, but experiment',
    'and invention have largely stopped, and the',
    'ravages of the atomic war of the nineteen-fifties',
    'have never been fully repaired. Nevertheless',
    'the dangers inherent in the machine are still',
    'there. From the moment when the machine first',
    'made its appearance it was clear to all thinking',
    'people that the need for human drudgery,',
    'and therefore to a great extent for human',
    'inequality, had disappeared. If the machine',
    'were used deliberately for that end, hunger,',
    'overwork, dirt, illiteracy, and disease could',
    'be eliminated within a few generations. And',
    'in fact, without being used for any such',
    'purpose, but by a sort of automatic process,',
    'by producing wealth which it was sometimes',
    'impossible not to distribute, the machine',
    'did raise the living standards of the average',
    'human being very greatly over a period of',
    'about fifty years at the end of the nineteenth',
    'and the beginning of the twentieth centuries.',
    'But it was also clear that an all-round increase',
    'in wealth threatened the destruction, indeed,',
    'in some sense was the destruction, of a hierarchical',
    'society. In a world in which everyone worked',
    'short hours, had enough to eat, lived in',
    'a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator,',
    'and possessed a motor-car or even an aeroplane,',
    'the most obvious and perhaps the most important',
    'form of inequality would already have disappeared.',
    'If it once became general, wealth would confer',
    'no distinction. It was possible, no doubt,',
    'to imagine a society in which WEALTH, in',
    'the sense of personal possessions and luxuries,',
    'should be evenly distributed, while POWER',
    'remained in the hands of a small privileged',
    'caste. But in practice such a society could',
    'not long remain stable. For if leisure and',
    'security were enjoyed by all alike, the great',
    'mass of human beings who are normally stupefied',
    'by poverty would become literate and would',
    'learn to think for themselves; and when once',
    'they had done this, they would sooner or',
    'later realize that the privileged minority',
    'had no function, and they would sweep it',
    'away. In the long run, a hierarchical society',
    'was only possible on a basis of poverty and',
    'ignorance. To return to the agricultural',
    'past, as some thinkers about the beginning',
    'of the twentieth century dreamed of doing,',
    'was not a practicable solution. It conflicted',
    'with the tendency towards mechanization which',
    'had become quasi-instinctive throughout almost',
    'the whole world, and moreover, any country',
    'which remained industrially backward was',
    'helpless in a military sense and was bound',
    'to be dominated, directly or indirectly,',
    'by its more advanced rivals. Nor was it a',
    'satisfactory solution to keep the masses',
    'in poverty by restricting the output of goods.',
    'This happened to a great extent during the',
    'final phase of capitalism, roughly between',
    '1920 and 1940. The economy of many countries',
    'was allowed to stagnate, land went out of',
    'cultivation, capital equipment was not added',
    'to, great blocks of the population were prevented',
    'from working and kept half alive by State',
    'charity. But this, too, entailed military',
    'weakness, and since the privations it inflicted',
    'were obviously unnecessary, it made opposition',
    'inevitable. The problem was how to keep the',
    'wheels of industry turning without increasing',
    'the real wealth of the world. Goods must',
    'be produced, but they must not be distributed.',
    'And in practice the only way of achieving',
    'this was by continuous warfare. The essential',
    'act of war is destruction, not necessarily',
    'of human lives, but of the products of human',
    'labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces,',
    'or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking',
    'in the depths of the sea, materials which',
    'might otherwise be used to make the masses',
    'too comfortable, and hence, in the long run,',
    'too intelligent. Even when weapons of war',
    'are not actually destroyed, their manufacture',
    'is still a convenient way of expending labour',
    'power without producing anything that can',
    'be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example,',
    'has locked up in it the labour that would',
    'build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately',
    'it is scrapped as obsolete, never having',
    'brought any material benefit to anybody,',
    'and with further enormous labours another',
    'Floating Fortress is built. In principle',
    'the war effort is always so planned as to',
    'eat up any surplus that might exist after',
    'meeting the bare needs of the population.',
    'In practice the needs of the population are',
    'always underestimated, with the result that',
    'there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities',
    'of life; but this is looked on as an advantage.',
    'It is deliberate policy to keep even the',
    'favoured groups somewhere near the brink',
    'of hardship, because a general state of scarcity',
    'increases the importance of small privileges',
    'and thus magnifies the distinction between',
    'one group and another. By the standards of',
    'the early twentieth century, even a member',
    'of the Inner Party lives an austere, laborious',
    'kind of life. Nevertheless, the few luxuries',
    'that he does enjoy his large, well-appointed',
    'flat, the better texture of his clothes,',
    'the better quality of his food and drink',
    'and tobacco, his two or three servants, his',
    'private motor-car or helicopter, set him',
    'in a different world from a member of the',
    'Outer Party, and the members of the Outer',
    'Party have a similar advantage in comparison',
    'with the submerged masses whom we call \'the',
    'proles\'. The social atmosphere is that of',
    'a besieged city, where the possession of',
    'a lump of horseflesh makes the difference',
    'between wealth and poverty. And at the same',
    'time the consciousness of being at war, and',
    'therefore in danger, makes the handing-over',
    'of all power to a small caste seem the natural,',
    'unavoidable condition of survival. War, it',
    'will be seen, accomplishes the necessary',
    'destruction, but accomplishes it in a psychologically',
    'acceptable way. In principle it would be',
    'quite simple to waste the surplus labour',
    'of the world by building temples and pyramids,',
    'by digging holes and filling them up again,',
    'or even by producing vast quantities of goods',
    'and then setting fire to them. But this would',
    'provide only the economic and not the emotional',
    'basis for a hierarchical society. What is',
    'concerned here is not the morale of masses,',
    'whose attitude is unimportant so long as',
    'they are kept steadily at work, but the morale',
    'of the Party itself. Even the humblest Party',
    'member is expected to be competent, industrious,',
    'and even intelligent within narrow limits,',
    'but it is also necessary that he should be',
    'a credulous and ignorant fanatic whose prevailing',
    'moods are fear, hatred, adulation, and orgiastic',
    'triumph. In other words it is necessary that',
    'he should have the mentality appropriate',
    'to a state of war. It does not matter whether',
    'the war is actually happening, and, since',
    'no decisive victory is possible, it does',
    'not matter whether the war is going well',
    'or badly. All that is needed is that a state',
    'of war should exist. The splitting of the',
    'intelligence which the Party requires of',
    'its members, and which is more easily achieved',
    'in an atmosphere of war, is now almost universal,',
    'but the higher up the ranks one goes, the',
    'more marked it becomes. It is precisely in',
    'the Inner Party that war hysteria and hatred',
    'of the enemy are strongest. In his capacity',
    'as an administrator, it is often necessary',
    'for a member of the Inner Party to know that',
    'this or that item of war news is untruthful,',
    'and he may often be aware that the entire',
    'war is spurious and is either not happening',
    'or is being waged for purposes quite other',
    'than the declared ones: but such knowledge',
    'is easily neutralized by the technique of',
    'DOUBLETHINK. Meanwhile no Inner Party member',
    'wavers for an instant in his mystical belief',
    'that the war is real, and that it is bound',
    'to end victoriously, with Oceania the undisputed',
    'master of the entire world. All members of',
    'the Inner Party believe in this coming conquest',
    'as an article of faith. It is to be achieved',
    'either by gradually acquiring more and more',
    'territory and so building up an overwhelming',
    'preponderance of power, or by the discovery',
    'of some new and unanswerable weapon. The',
    'search for new weapons continues unceasingly,',
    'and is one of the very few remaining activities',
    'in which the inventive or speculative type',
    'of mind can find any outlet. In Oceania at',
    'the present day, Science, in the old sense,',
    'has almost ceased to exist. In Newspeak there',
    'is no word for \'Science\'. The empirical method',
    'of thought, on which all the scientific achievements',
    'of the past were founded, is opposed to the',
    'most fundamental principles of Ingsoc. And',
    'even technological progress only happens',
    'when its products can in some way be used',
    'for the diminution of human liberty. In all',
    'the useful arts the world is either standing',
    'still or going backwards. The fields are',
    'cultivated with horse-ploughs while books',
    'are written by machinery. But in matters',
    'of vital importance, meaning, in effect,',
    'war and police espionage, the empirical approach',
    'is still encouraged, or at least tolerated.',
    'The two aims of the Party are to conquer',
    'the whole surface of the earth and to extinguish',
    'once and for all the possibility of independent',
    'thought. There are therefore two great problems',
    'which the Party is concerned to solve. One',
    'is how to discover, against his will, what',
    'another human being is thinking, and the',
    'other is how to kill several hundred million',
    'people in a few seconds without giving warning',
    'beforehand. In so far as scientific research',
    'still continues, this is its subject matter.',
    'The scientist of today is either a mixture',
    'of psychologist and inquisitor, studying',
    'with real ordinary minuteness the meaning',
    'of facial expressions, gestures, and tones',
    'of voice, and testing the truth-producing',
    'effects of drugs, shock therapy, hypnosis,',
    'and physical torture; or he is chemist, physicist,',
    'or biologist concerned only with such branches',
    'of his special subject as are relevant to',
    'the taking of life. In the vast laboratories',
    'of the Ministry of Peace, and in the experimental',
    'stations hidden in the Brazilian forests,',
    'or in the Australian desert, or on lost islands',
    'of the Antarctic, the teams of experts are',
    'indefatigably at work. Some are concerned',
    'simply with planning the logistics of future',
    'wars; others devise larger and larger rocket',
    'bombs, more and more powerful explosives,',
    'and more and more impenetrable armour-plating;',
    'others search for new and deadlier gases,',
    'or for soluble poisons capable of being produced',
    'in such quantities as to destroy the vegetation',
    'of whole continents, or for breeds of disease',
    'germs immunized against all possible antibodies;',
    'others strive to produce a vehicle that shall',
    'bore its way under the soil like a submarine',
    'under the water, or an aeroplane as independent',
    'of its base as a sailing-ship; others explore',
    'even remoter possibilities such as focusing',
    'the sun\'s rays through lenses suspended thousands',
    'of kilometres away in space, or producing',
    'artificial earthquakes and tidal waves by',
    'tapping the heat at the earth\'s centre. But',
    'none of these projects ever comes anywhere',
    'near realization, and none of the three super-states',
    'ever gains a significant lead on the others.',
    'What is more remarkable is that all three',
    'powers already possess, in the atomic bomb,',
    'a weapon far more powerful than any that',
    'their present researches are likely to discover.',
    'Although the Party, according to its habit,',
    'claims the invention for itself, atomic bombs',
    'first appeared as early as the nineteen-forties,',
    'and were first used on a large scale about',
    'ten years later. At that time some hundreds',
    'of bombs were dropped on industrial centres,',
    'chiefly in European Russia, Western Europe,',
    'and North America. The effect was to convince',
    'the ruling groups of all countries that a',
    'few more atomic bombs would mean the end',
    'of organized society, and hence of their',
    'own power. Thereafter, although no formal',
    'agreement was ever made or hinted at, no',
    'more bombs were dropped. All three powers',
    'merely continue to produce atomic bombs and',
    'store them up against the decisive opportunity',
    'which they all believe will come sooner or',
    'later. And meanwhile the art of war has remained',
    'almost stationary for thirty or forty years.',
    'Helicopters are more used than they were',
    'formerly, bombing planes have been largely',
    'superseded by self-propelled projectiles,',
    'and the fragile movable battleship has given',
    'way to the almost unsinkable Floating Fortress;',
    'but otherwise there has been little development.',
    'The tank, the submarine, the torpedo, the',
    'machine gun, even the rifle and the hand',
    'grenade are still in use. And in spite of',
    'the endless slaughters reported in the Press',
    'and on the telescreens, the desperate battles',
    'of earlier wars, in which hundreds of thousands',
    'or even millions of men were often killed',
    'in a few weeks, have never been repeated.',
    'None of the three super-states ever attempts',
    'any manoeuvre which involves the risk of',
    'serious defeat. When any large operation',
    'is undertaken, it is usually a surprise attack',
    'against an ally. The strategy that all three',
    'powers are following, or pretend to themselves',
    'that they are following, is the same. The',
    'plan is, by a combination of fighting, bargaining,',
    'and well-timed strokes of treachery, to acquire',
    'a ring of bases completely encircling one',
    'or other of the rival states, and then to',
    'sign a pact of friendship with that rival',
    'and remain on peaceful terms for so many',
    'years as to lull suspicion to sleep. During',
    'this time rockets loaded with atomic bombs',
    'can be assembled at all the strategic spots;',
    'finally they will all be fired simultaneously,',
    'with effects so devastating as to make retaliation',
    'impossible. It will then be time to sign',
    'a pact of friendship with the remaining world-power,',
    'in preparation for another attack. This scheme,',
    'it is hardly necessary to say, is a mere',
    'daydream, impossible of realization. Moreover,',
    'no fighting ever occurs except in the disputed',
    'areas round the Equator and the Pole: no',
    'invasion of enemy territory is ever undertaken.',
    'This explains the fact that in some places',
    'the frontiers between the super-states are',
    'arbitrary. Eurasia, for example, could easily',
    'conquer the British Isles, which are geographically',
    'part of Europe, or on the other hand it would',
    'be possible for Oceania to push its frontiers',
    'to the Rhine or even to the Vistula. But',
    'this would violate the principle, followed',
    'on all sides though never formulated, of',
    'cultural integrity. If Oceania were to conquer',
    'the areas that used once to be known as France',
    'and Germany, it would be necessary either',
    'to exterminate the inhabitants, a task of',
    'great physical difficulty, or to assimilate',
    'a population of about a hundred million people,',
    'who, so far as technical development goes,',
    'are roughly on the Oceanic level. The problem',
    'is the same for all three super-states. It',
    'is absolutely necessary to their structure',
    'that there should be no contact with foreigners,',
    'except, to a limited extent, with war prisoners',
    'and coloured slaves. Even the official ally',
    'of the moment is always regarded with the',
    'darkest suspicion. War prisoners apart, the',
    'average citizen of Oceania never sets eyes',
    'on a citizen of either Eurasia or Eastasia,',
    'and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign',
    'languages. If he were allowed contact with',
    'foreigners he would discover that they are',
    'creatures similar to himself and that most',
    'of what he has been told about them is lies.',
    'The sealed world in which he lives would',
    'be broken, and the fear, hatred, and self-righteousness',
    'on which his morale depends might evaporate.',
    'It is therefore realized on all sides that',
    'however often Persia, or Egypt, or Java,',
    'or Ceylon may change hands, the main frontiers',
    'must never be crossed by anything except',
    'bombs. Under this lies a fact never mentioned',
    'aloud, but tacitly understood and acted upon:',
    'namely, that the conditions of life in all',
    'three super-states are very much the same.',
    'In Oceania the prevailing philosophy is called',
    'Ingsoc, in Eurasia it is called Neo-Bolshevism,',
    'and in Eastasia it is called by a Chinese',
    'name usually translated as Death-Worship,',
    'but perhaps better rendered as Obliteration',
    'of the Self. The citizen of Oceania is not',
    'allowed to know anything of the tenets of',
    'the other two philosophies, but he is taught',
    'to execrate them as barbarous outrages upon',
    'morality and common sense. Actually the three',
    'philosophies are barely distinguishable,',
    'and the social systems which they support',
    'are not distinguishable at all. Everywhere',
    'there is the same pyramidal structure, the',
    'same worship of semi-divine leader, the same',
    'economy existing by and for continuous warfare.',
    'It follows that the three super-states not',
    'only cannot conquer one another, but would',
    'gain no advantage by doing so. On the contrary,',
    'so long as they remain in conflict they prop',
    'one another up, like three sheaves of corn.',
    'And, as usual, the ruling groups of all three',
    'powers are simultaneously aware and unaware',
    'of what they are doing. Their lives are dedicated',
    'to world conquest, but they also know that',
    'it is necessary that the war should continue',
    'everlastingly and without victory. Meanwhile',
    'the fact that there IS no danger of conquest',
    'makes possible the denial of reality which',
    'is the special feature of Ingsoc and its',
    'rival systems of thought. Here it is necessary',
    'to repeat what has been said earlier, that',
    'by becoming continuous war has fundamentally',
    'changed its character. In past ages, a war,',
    'almost by definition, was something that',
    'sooner or later came to an end, usually in',
    'unmistakable victory or defeat. In the past,',
    'also, war was one of the main instruments',
    'by which human societies were kept in touch',
    'with physical reality. All rulers in all',
    'ages have tried to impose a false view of',
    'the world upon their followers, but they',
    'could not afford to encourage any illusion',
    'that tended to impair military efficiency.',
    'So long as defeat meant the loss of independence,',
    'or some other result generally held to be',
    'undesirable, the precautions against defeat',
    'had to be serious. Physical facts could not',
    'be ignored. In philosophy, or religion, or',
    'ethics, or politics, two and two might make',
    'five, but when one was designing a gun or',
    'an aeroplane they had to make four. Inefficient',
    'nations were always conquered sooner or later,',
    'and the struggle for efficiency was inimical',
    'to illusions. Moreover, to be efficient it',
    'was necessary to be able to learn from the',
    'past, which meant having a fairly accurate',
    'idea of what had happened in the past. Newspapers',
    'and history books were, of course, always',
    'coloured and biased, but falsification of',
    'the kind that is practised today would have',
    'been impossible. War was a sure safeguard',
    'of sanity, and so far as the ruling classes',
    'were concerned it was probably the most important',
    'of all safeguards. While wars could be won',
    'or lost, no ruling class could be completely',
    'irresponsible. But when war becomes literally',
    'continuous, it also ceases to be dangerous.',
    'When war is continuous there is no such thing',
    'as military necessity. Technical progress',
    'can cease and the most palpable facts can',
    'be denied or disregarded. As we have seen,',
    'researches that could be called scientific',
    'are still carried out for the purposes of',
    'war, but they are essentially a kind of daydreaming,',
    'and their failure to show results is not',
    'important. Efficiency, even military efficiency,',
    'is no longer needed. Nothing is efficient',
    'in Oceania except the Thought Police. Since',
    'each of the three super-states is unconquerable,',
    'each is in effect a separate universe within',
    'which almost any perversion of thought can',
    'be safely practised. Reality only exerts',
    'its pressure through the needs of everyday',
    'life, the need to eat and drink, to get shelter',
    'and clothing, to avoid swallowing poison',
    'or stepping out of top-storey windows, and',
    'the like. Between life and death, and between',
    'physical pleasure and physical pain, there',
    'is still a distinction, but that is all.',
    'Cut off from contact with the outer world,',
    'and with the past, the citizen of Oceania',
    'is like a man in interstellar space, who',
    'has no way of knowing which direction is',
    'up and which is down. The rulers of such',
    'a state are absolute, as the Pharaohs or',
    'the Caesars could not be. They are obliged',
    'to prevent their followers from starving',
    'to death in numbers large enough to be inconvenient,',
    'and they are obliged to remain at the same',
    'low level of military technique as their',
    'rivals; but once that minimum is achieved,',
    'they can twist reality into whatever shape',
    'they choose. The war, therefore, if we judge',
    'it by the standards of previous wars, is',
    'merely an imposture. It is like the battles',
    'between certain ruminant animals whose horns',
    'are set at such an angle that they are incapable',
    'of hurting one another. But though it is',
    'unreal it is not meaningless. It eats up',
    'the surplus of consumable goods, and it helps',
    'to preserve the special mental atmosphere',
    'that a hierarchical society needs. War, it',
    'will be seen, is now a purely internal affair.',
    'In the past, the ruling groups of all countries,',
    'although they might recognize their common',
    'interest and therefore limit the destructiveness',
    'of war, did fight against one another, and',
    'the victor always plundered the vanquished.',
    'In our own day they are not fighting against',
    'one another at all. The war is waged by each',
    'ruling group against its own subjects, and',
    'the object of the war is not to make or prevent',
    'conquests of territory, but to keep the structure',
    'of society intact. The very word \'war\', therefore,',
    'has become misleading. It would probably',
    'be accurate to say that by becoming continuous',
    'war has ceased to exist. The peculiar pressure',
    'that it exerted on human beings between the',
    'Neolithic Age and the early twentieth century',
    'has disappeared and been replaced by something',
    'quite different. The effect would be much',
    'the same if the three super-states, instead',
    'of fighting one another, should agree to',
    'live in perpetual peace, each inviolate within',
    'its own boundaries. For in that case each',
    'would still be a self-contained universe,',
    'freed for ever from the sobering influence',
    'of external danger. A peace that was truly',
    'permanent would be the same as a permanent',
    'war. This, although the vast majority of',
    'Party members understand it only in a shallower',
    'sense, is the inner meaning of the Party',
    'slogan: WAR IS PEACE. Winston stopped reading',
    'for a moment. Somewhere in remote distance',
    'a rocket bomb thundered. The blissful feeling',
    'of being alone with the forbidden book, in',
    'a room with no telescreen, had not worn off.',
    'Solitude and safety were physical sensations,',
    'mixed up somehow with the tiredness of his',
    'body, the softness of the chair, the touch',
    'of the faint breeze from the window that',
    'played upon his cheek. The book fascinated',
    'him, or more exactly it reassured him. In',
    'a sense it told him nothing that was new,',
    'but that was part of the attraction. It said',
    'what he would have said, if it had been possible',
    'for him to set his scattered thoughts in',
    'order. It was the product of a mind similar',
    'to his own, but enormously more powerful,',
    'more systematic, less fear-ridden. The best',
    'books, he perceived, are those that tell',
    'you what you know already. He had just turned',
    'back to Chapter I when he heard Julia\'s footstep',
    'on the stair and started out of his chair',
    'to meet her. She dumped her brown tool-bag',
    'on the floor and flung herself into his arms.',
    'It was more than a week since they had seen',
    'one another. \'I\'ve got THE BOOK,\' he said',
    'as they disentangled themselves. \'Oh, you\'ve',
    'got it? Good,\' she said without much interest,',
    'and almost immediately knelt down beside',
    'the oil stove to make the coffee. They did',
    'not return to the subject until they had',
    'been in bed for half an hour. The evening',
    'was just cool enough to make it worth while',
    'to pull up the counterpane. From below came',
    'the familiar sound of singing and the scrape',
    'of boots on the flagstones. The brawny red-armed',
    'woman whom Winston had seen there on his',
    'first visit was almost a fixture in the yard.',
    'There seemed to be no hour of daylight when',
    'she was not marching to and fro between the',
    'washtub and the line, alternately gagging',
    'herself with clothes pegs and breaking forth',
    'into lusty song. Julia had settled down on',
    'her side and seemed to be already on the',
    'point of falling asleep. He reached out for',
    'the book, which was lying on the floor, and',
    'sat up against the bedhead. \'We must read',
    'it,\' he said. \'You too. All members of the',
    'Brotherhood have to read it.\' \'You read it,\'',
    'she said with her eyes shut. \'Read it aloud.',
    'That\'s the best way. Then you can explain',
    'it to me as you go.\' The clock\'s hands said',
    'six, meaning eighteen. They had three or',
    'four hours ahead of them. He propped the',
    'book against his knees and began reading:',
    'Chapter I Ignorance is Strength Throughout',
    'recorded time, and probably since the end',
    'of the Neolithic Age, there have been three',
    'kinds of people in the world, the High, the',
    'Middle, and the Low. They have been subdivided',
    'in many ways, they have borne countless different',
    'names, and their relative numbers, as well',
    'as their attitude towards one another, have',
    'varied from age to age: but the essential',
    'structure of society has never altered. Even',
    'after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable',
    'changes, the same pattern has always reasserted',
    'itself, just as a gyroscope will always return',
    'to equilibrium, however far it is pushed',
    'one way or the other \'Julia, are you awake?\'',
    'said Winston. \'Yes, my love, I\'m listening.',
    'Go on. It\'s marvellous.\' He continued reading:',
    'The aims of these three groups are entirely',
    'irreconcilable. The aim of the High is to',
    'remain where they are. The aim of the Middle',
    'is to change places with the High. The aim',
    'of the Low, when they have an aim, for it',
    'is an abiding characteristic of the Low that',
    'they are too much crushed by drudgery to',
    'be more than intermittently conscious of',
    'anything outside their daily lives, is to',
    'abolish all distinctions and create a society',
    'in which all men shall be equal. Thus throughout',
    'history a struggle which is the same in its',
    'main outlines recurs over and over again.',
    'For long periods the High seem to be securely',
    'in power, but sooner or later there always',
    'comes a moment when they lose either their',
    'belief in themselves or their capacity to',
    'govern efficiently, or both. They are then',
    'overthrown by the Middle, who enlist the',
    'Low on their side by pretending to them that',
    'they are fighting for liberty and justice.',
    'As soon as they have reached their objective,',
    'the Middle thrust the Low back into their',
    'old position of servitude, and themselves',
    'become the High. Presently a new Middle group',
    'splits off from one of the other groups,',
    'or from both of them, and the struggle begins',
    'over again. Of the three groups, only the',
    'Low are never even temporarily successful',
    'in achieving their aims. It would be an exaggeration',
    'to say that throughout history there has',
    'been no progress of a material kind. Even',
    'today, in a period of decline, the average',
    'human being is physically better off than',
    'he was a few centuries ago. But no advance',
    'in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform',
    'or revolution has ever brought human equality',
    'a millimetre nearer. From the point of view',
    'of the Low, no historic change has ever meant',
    'much more than a change in the name of their',
    'masters. By the late nineteenth century the',
    'recurrence of this pattern had become obvious',
    'to many observers. There then rose schools',
    'of thinkers who interpreted history as a',
    'cyclical process and claimed to show that',
    'inequality was the unalterable law of human',
    'life. This doctrine, of course, had always',
    'had its adherents, but in the manner in which',
    'it was now put forward there was a significant',
    'change. In the past the need for a hierarchical',
    'form of society had been the doctrine specifically',
    'of the High. It had been preached by kings',
    'and aristocrats and by the priests, lawyers,',
    'and the like who were parasitical upon them,',
    'and it had generally been softened by promises',
    'of compensation in an imaginary world beyond',
    'the grave. The Middle, so long as it was',
    'struggling for power, had always made use',
    'of such terms as freedom, justice, and fraternity.',
    'Now, however, the concept of human brotherhood',
    'began to be assailed by people who were not',
    'yet in positions of command, but merely hoped',
    'to be so before long. In the past the Middle',
    'had made revolutions under the banner of',
    'equality, and then had established a fresh',
    'tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown.',
    'The new Middle groups in effect proclaimed',
    'their tyranny beforehand. Socialism, a theory',
    'which appeared in the early nineteenth century',
    'and was the last link in a chain of thought',
    'stretching back to the slave rebellions of',
    'antiquity, was still deeply infected by the',
    'Utopianism of past ages. But in each variant',
    'of Socialism that appeared from about 1900',
    'onwards the aim of establishing liberty and',
    'equality was more and more openly abandoned.',
    'The new movements which appeared in the middle',
    'years of the century, Ingsoc in Oceania,',
    'Neo-Bolshevism in Eurasia, Death-Worship,',
    'as it is commonly called, in Eastasia, had',
    'the conscious aim of perpetuating UNfreedom',
    'and INequality. These new movements, of course,',
    'grew out of the old ones and tended to keep',
    'their names and pay lip-service to their',
    'ideology. But the purpose of all of them',
    'was to arrest progress and freeze history',
    'at a chosen moment. The familiar pendulum',
    'swing was to happen once more, and then stop.',
    'As usual, the High were to be turned out',
    'by the Middle, who would then become the',
    'High; but this time, by conscious strategy,',
    'the High would be able to maintain their',
    'position permanently. The new doctrines arose',
    'partly because of the accumulation of historical',
    'knowledge, and the growth of the historical',
    'sense, which had hardly existed before the',
    'nineteenth century. The cyclical movement',
    'of history was now intelligible, or appeared',
    'to be so; and if it was intelligible, then',
    'it was alterable. But the principal, underlying',
    'cause was that, as early as the beginning',
    'of the twentieth century, human equality',
    'had become technically possible. It was still',
    'true that men were not equal in their native',
    'talents and that functions had to be specialized',
    'in ways that favoured some individuals against',
    'others; but there was no longer any real',
    'need for class distinctions or for large',
    'differences of wealth. In earlier ages, class',
    'distinctions had been not only inevitable',
    'but desirable. Inequality was the price of',
    'civilization. With the development of machine',
    'production, however, the case was altered.',
    'Even if it was still necessary for human',
    'beings to do different kinds of work, it',
    'was no longer necessary for them to live',
    'at different social or economic levels. Therefore,',
    'from the point of view of the new groups',
    'who were on the point of seizing power, human',
    'equality was no longer an ideal to be striven',
    'after, but a danger to be averted. In more',
    'primitive ages, when a just and peaceful',
    'society was in fact not possible, it had',
    'been fairly easy to believe it. The idea',
    'of an earthly paradise in which men should',
    'live together in a state of brotherhood,',
    'without laws and without brute labour, had',
    'haunted the human imagination for thousands',
    'of years. And this vision had had a certain',
    'hold even on the groups who actually profited',
    'by each historical change. The heirs of the',
    'French, English, and American revolutions',
    'had partly believed in their own phrases',
    'about the rights of man, freedom of speech,',
    'equality before the law, and the like, and',
    'have even allowed their conduct to be influenced',
    'by them to some extent. But by the fourth',
    'decade of the twentieth century all the main',
    'currents of political thought were authoritarian.',
    'The earthly paradise had been discredited',
    'at exactly the moment when it became realizable.',
    'Every new political theory, by whatever name',
    'it called itself, led back to hierarchy and',
    'regimentation. And in the general hardening',
    'of outlook that set in round about 1930,',
    'practices which had been long abandoned,',
    'in some cases for hundreds of years, imprisonment',
    'without trial, the use of war prisoners as',
    'slaves, public executions, torture to extract',
    'confessions, the use of hostages, and the',
    'deportation of whole populations, not only',
    'became common again, but were tolerated and',
    'even defended by people who considered themselves',
    'enlightened and progressive. It was only',
    'after a decade of national wars, civil wars,',
    'revolutions, and counter-revolutions in all',
    'parts of the world that Ingsoc and its rivals',
    'emerged as fully worked-out political theories.',
    'But they had been foreshadowed by the various',
    'systems, generally called totalitarian, which',
    'had appeared earlier in the century, and',
    'the main outlines of the world which would',
    'emerge from the prevailing chaos had long',
    'been obvious. What kind of people would control',
    'this world had been equally obvious. The',
    'new aristocracy was made up for the most',
    'part of bureaucrats, scientists, technicians,',
    'trade-union organizers, publicity experts,',
    'sociologists, teachers, journalists, and',
    'professional politicians. These people, whose',
    'origins lay in the salaried middle class',
    'and the upper grades of the working class,',
    'had been shaped and brought together by the',
    'barren world of monopoly industry and centralized',
    'government. As compared with their opposite',
    'numbers in past ages, they were less avaricious,',
    'less tempted by luxury, hungrier for pure',
    'power, and, above all, more conscious of',
    'what they were doing and more intent on crushing',
    'opposition. This last difference was cardinal.',
    'By comparison with that existing today, all',
    'the tyrannies of the past were half-hearted',
    'and inefficient. The ruling groups were always',
    'infected to some extent by liberal ideas,',
    'and were content to leave loose ends everywhere,',
    'to regard only the overt act and to be uninterested',
    'in what their subjects were thinking. Even',
    'the Catholic Church of the Middle Ages was',
    'tolerant by modern standards. Part of the',
    'reason for this was that in the past no government',
    'had the power to keep its citizens under',
    'constant surveillance. The invention of print,',
    'however, made it easier to manipulate public',
    'opinion, and the film and the radio carried',
    'the process further. With the development',
    'of television, and the technical advance',
    'which made it possible to receive and transmit',
    'simultaneously on the same instrument, private',
    'life came to an end. Every citizen, or at',
    'least every citizen important enough to be',
    'worth watching, could be kept for twenty-four',
    'hours a day under the eyes of the police',
    'and in the sound of official propaganda,',
    'with all other channels of communication',
    'closed. The possibility of enforcing not',
    'only complete obedience to the will of the',
    'State, but complete uniformity of opinion',
    'on all subjects, now existed for the first',
    'time. After the revolutionary period of the',
    'fifties and sixties, society regrouped itself,',
    'as always, into High, Middle, and Low. But',
    'the new High group, unlike all its forerunners,',
    'did not act upon instinct but knew what was',
    'needed to safeguard its position. It had',
    'long been realized that the only secure basis',
    'for oligarchy is collectivism. Wealth and',
    'privilege are most easily defended when they',
    'are possessed jointly. The so-called \'abolition',
    'of private property\' which took place in',
    'the middle years of the century meant, in',
    'effect, the concentration of property in',
    'far fewer hands than before: but with this',
    'difference, that the new owners were a group',
    'instead of a mass of individuals. Individually,',
    'no member of the Party owns anything, except',
    'petty personal belongings. Collectively,',
    'the Party owns everything in Oceania, because',
    'it controls everything, and disposes of the',
    'products as it thinks fit. In the years following',
    'the Revolution it was able to step into this',
    'commanding position almost unopposed, because',
    'the whole process was represented as an act',
    'of collectivization. It had always been assumed',
    'that if the capitalist class were expropriated,',
    'Socialism must follow: and unquestionably',
    'the capitalists had been expropriated. Factories,',
    'mines, land, houses, transport, everything',
    'had been taken away from them: and since',
    'these things were no longer private property,',
    'it followed that they must be public property.',
    'Ingsoc, which grew out of the earlier Socialist',
    'movement and inherited its phraseology, has',
    'in fact carried out the main item in the',
    'Socialist programme; with the result, foreseen',
    'and intended beforehand, that economic inequality',
    'has been made permanent. But the problems',
    'of perpetuating a hierarchical society go',
    'deeper than this. There are only four ways',
    'in which a ruling group can fall from power.',
    'Either it is conquered from without, or it',
    'governs so inefficiently that the masses',
    'are stirred to revolt, or it allows a strong',
    'and discontented Middle group to come into',
    'being, or it loses its own self-confidence',
    'and willingness to govern. These causes do',
    'not operate singly, and as a rule all four',
    'of them are present in some degree. A ruling',
    'class which could guard against all of them',
    'would remain in power permanently. Ultimately',
    'the determining factor is the mental attitude',
    'of the ruling class itself. After the middle',
    'of the present century, the first danger',
    'had in reality disappeared. Each of the three',
    'powers which now divide the world is in fact',
    'unconquerable, and could only become conquerable',
    'through slow demographic changes which a',
    'government with wide powers can easily avert.',
    'The second danger, also, is only a theoretical',
    'one. The masses never revolt of their own',
    'accord, and they never revolt merely because',
    'they are oppressed. Indeed, so long as they',
    'are not permitted to have standards of comparison,',
    'they never even become aware that they are',
    'oppressed. The recurrent economic crises',
    'of past times were totally unnecessary and',
    'are not now permitted to happen, but other',
    'and equally large dislocations can and do',
    'happen without having political results,',
    'because there is no way in which discontent',
    'can become articulate. As for the problem',
    'of over-production, which has been latent',
    'in our society since the development of machine',
    'technique, it is solved by the device of',
    'continuous warfare (see Chapter III), which',
    'is also useful in keying up public morale',
    'to the necessary pitch. From the point of',
    'view of our present rulers, therefore, the',
    'only genuine dangers are the splitting-off',
    'of a new group of able, under-employed, power-hungry',
    'people, and the growth of liberalism and',
    'scepticism in their own ranks. The problem,',
    'that is to say, is educational. It is a problem',
    'of continuously moulding the consciousness',
    'both of the directing group and of the larger',
    'executive group that lies immediately below',
    'it. The consciousness of the masses needs',
    'only to be influenced in a negative way.',
    'Given this background, one could infer, if',
    'one did not know it already, the general',
    'structure of Oceanic society. At the apex',
    'of the pyramid comes Big Brother. Big Brother',
    'is infallible and all-powerful. Every success,',
    'every achievement, every victory, every scientific',
    'discovery, all knowledge, all wisdom, all',
    'happiness, all virtue, are held to issue',
    'directly from his leadership and inspiration.',
    'Nobody has ever seen Big Brother. He is a',
    'face on the hoardings, a voice on the telescreen.',
    'We may be reasonably sure that he will never',
    'die, and there is already considerable uncertainty',
    'as to when he was born. Big Brother is the',
    'guise in which the Party chooses to exhibit',
    'itself to the world. His function is to act',
    'as a focusing point for love, fear, and reverence,',
    'emotions which are more easily felt towards',
    'an individual than towards an organization.',
    'Below Big Brother comes the Inner Party.',
    'Its numbers limited to six millions, or something',
    'less than 2 per cent of the population of',
    'Oceania. Below the Inner Party comes the',
    'Outer Party, which, if the Inner Party is',
    'described as the brain of the State, may',
    'be justly likened to the hands. Below that',
    'come the dumb masses whom we habitually refer',
    'to as \'the proles\', numbering perhaps 85',
    'per cent of the population. In the terms',
    'of our earlier classification, the proles',
    'are the Low: for the slave population of',
    'the equatorial lands who pass constantly',
    'from conqueror to conqueror, are not a permanent',
    'or necessary part of the structure. In principle,',
    'membership of these three groups is not hereditary.',
    'The child of Inner Party parents is in theory',
    'not born into the Inner Party. Admission',
    'to either branch of the Party is by examination,',
    'taken at the age of sixteen. Nor is there',
    'any racial discrimination, or any marked',
    'domination of one province by another. Jews,',
    'Negroes, South Americans of pure Indian blood',
    'are to be found in the highest ranks of the',
    'Party, and the administrators of any area',
    'are always drawn from the inhabitants of',
    'that area. In no part of Oceania do the inhabitants',
    'have the feeling that they are a colonial',
    'population ruled from a distant capital.',
    'Oceania has no capital, and its titular head',
    'is a person whose whereabouts nobody knows.',
    'Except that English is its chief LINGUA FRANCA',
    'and Newspeak its official language, it is',
    'not centralized in any way. Its rulers are',
    'not held together by blood-ties but by adherence',
    'to a common doctrine. It is true that our',
    'society is stratified, and very rigidly stratified,',
    'on what at first sight appear to be hereditary',
    'lines. There is far less to-and-fro movement',
    'between the different groups than happened',
    'under capitalism or even in the pre-industrial',
    'age. Between the two branches of the Party',
    'there is a certain amount of interchange,',
    'but only so much as will ensure that weaklings',
    'are excluded from the Inner Party and that',
    'ambitious members of the Outer Party are',
    'made harmless by allowing them to rise. Proletarians,',
    'in practice, are not allowed to graduate',
    'into the Party. The most gifted among them,',
    'who might possibly become nuclei of discontent,',
    'are simply marked down by the Thought Police',
    'and eliminated. But this state of affairs',
    'is not necessarily permanent, nor is it a',
    'matter of principle. The Party is not a class',
    'in the old sense of the word. It does not',
    'aim at transmitting power to its own children,',
    'as such; and if there were no other way of',
    'keeping the ablest people at the top, it',
    'would be perfectly prepared to recruit an',
    'entire new generation from the ranks of the',
    'proletariat. In the crucial years, the fact',
    'that the Party was not a hereditary body',
    'did a great deal to neutralize opposition.',
    'The older kind of Socialist, who had been',
    'trained to fight against something called',
    '\'class privilege\' assumed that what is not',
    'hereditary cannot be permanent. He did not',
    'see that the continuity of an oligarchy need',
    'not be physical, nor did he pause to reflect',
    'that hereditary aristocracies have always',
    'been shortlived, whereas adoptive organizations',
    'such as the Catholic Church have sometimes',
    'lasted for hundreds or thousands of years.',
    'The essence of oligarchical rule is not father-to-son',
    'inheritance, but the persistence of a certain',
    'world-view and a certain way of life, imposed',
    'by the dead upon the living. A ruling group',
    'is a ruling group so long as it can nominate',
    'its successors. The Party is not concerned',
    'with perpetuating its blood but with perpetuating',
    'itself. WHO wields power is not important,',
    'provided that the hierarchical structure',
    'remains always the same. All the beliefs,',
    'habits, tastes, emotions, mental attitudes',
    'that characterize our time are really designed',
    'to sustain the mystique of the Party and',
    'prevent the true nature of present-day society',
    'from being perceived. Physical rebellion,',
    'or any preliminary move towards rebellion,',
    'is at present not possible. From the proletarians',
    'nothing is to be feared. Left to themselves,',
    'they will continue from generation to generation',
    'and from century to century, working, breeding,',
    'and dying, not only without any impulse to',
    'rebel, but without the power of grasping',
    'that the world could be other than it is.',
    'They could only become dangerous if the advance',
    'of industrial technique made it necessary',
    'to educate them more highly; but, since military',
    'and commercial rivalry are no longer important,',
    'the level of popular education is actually',
    'declining. What opinions the masses hold,',
    'or do not hold, is looked on as a matter',
    'of indifference. They can be granted intellectual',
    'liberty because they have no intellect. In',
    'a Party member, on the other hand, not even',
    'the smallest deviation of opinion on the',
    'most unimportant subject can be tolerated.',
    'A Party member lives from birth to death',
    'under the eye of the Thought Police. Even',
    'when he is alone he can never be sure that',
    'he is alone. Wherever he may be, asleep or',
    'awake, working or resting, in his bath or',
    'in bed, he can be inspected without warning',
    'and without knowing that he is being inspected.',
    'Nothing that he does is indifferent. His',
    'friendships, his relaxations, his behaviour',
    'towards his wife and children, the expression',
    'of his face when he is alone, the words he',
    'mutters in sleep, even the characteristic',
    'movements of his body, are all jealously',
    'scrutinized. Not only any actual misdemeanour,',
    'but any eccentricity, however small, any',
    'change of habits, any nervous mannerism that',
    'could possibly be the symptom of an inner',
    'struggle, is certain to be detected. He has',
    'no freedom of choice in any direction whatever.',
    'On the other hand his actions are not regulated',
    'by law or by any clearly formulated code',
    'of behaviour. In Oceania there is no law.',
    'Thoughts and actions which, when detected,',
    'mean certain death are not formally forbidden,',
    'and the endless purges, arrests, tortures,',
    'imprisonments, and vaporizations are not',
    'inflicted as punishment for crimes which',
    'have actually been committed, but are merely',
    'the wiping-out of persons who might perhaps',
    'commit a crime at some time in the future.',
    'A Party member is required to have not only',
    'the right opinions, but the right instincts.',
    'Many of the beliefs and attitudes demanded',
    'of him are never plainly stated, and could',
    'not be stated without laying bare the contradictions',
    'inherent in Ingsoc. If he is a person naturally',
    'orthodox (in Newspeak a GOODTHINKER), he',
    'will in all circumstances know, without taking',
    'thought, what is the true belief or the desirable',
    'emotion. But in any case an elaborate mental',
    'training, undergone in childhood and grouping',
    'itself round the Newspeak words CRIMESTOP,',
    'BLACKWHITE, and DOUBLETHINK, makes him unwilling',
    'and unable to think too deeply on any subject',
    'whatever. A Party member is expected to have',
    'no private emotions and no respites from',
    'enthusiasm. He is supposed to live in a continuous',
    'frenzy of hatred of foreign enemies and internal',
    'traitors, triumph over victories, and self-abasement',
    'before the power and wisdom of the Party.',
    'The discontents produced by his bare, unsatisfying',
    'life are deliberately turned outwards and',
    'dissipated by such devices as the Two Minutes',
    'Hate, and the speculations which might possibly',
    'induce a sceptical or rebellious attitude',
    'are killed in advance by his early acquired',
    'inner discipline. The first and simplest',
    'stage in the discipline, which can be taught',
    'even to young children, is called, in Newspeak,',
    'CRIMESTOP. CRIMESTOP means the faculty of',
    'stopping short, as though by instinct, at',
    'the threshold of any dangerous thought. It',
    'includes the power of not grasping analogies,',
    'of failing to perceive logical errors, of',
    'misunderstanding the simplest arguments if',
    'they are inimical to Ingsoc, and of being',
    'bored or repelled by any train of thought',
    'which is capable of leading in a heretical',
    'direction. CRIMESTOP, in short, means protective',
    'stupidity. But stupidity is not enough. On',
    'the contrary, orthodoxy in the full sense',
    'demands a control over one\'s own mental processes',
    'as complete as that of a contortionist over',
    'his body. Oceanic society rests ultimately',
    'on the belief that Big Brother is omnipotent',
    'and that the Party is infallible. But since',
    'in reality Big Brother is not omnipotent',
    'and the party is not infallible, there is',
    'need for an unwearying, moment-to-moment',
    'flexibility in the treatment of facts. The',
    'keyword here is BLACKWHITE. Like so many',
    'Newspeak words, this word has two mutually',
    'contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent,',
    'it means the habit of impudently claiming',
    'that black is white, in contradiction of',
    'the plain facts. Applied to a Party member,',
    'it means a loyal willingness to say that',
    'black is white when Party discipline demands',
    'this. But it means also the ability to BELIEVE',
    'that black is white, and more, to KNOW that',
    'black is white, and to forget that one has',
    'ever believed the contrary. This demands',
    'a continuous alteration of the past, made',
    'possible by the system of thought which really',
    'embraces all the rest, and which is known',
    'in Newspeak as DOUBLETHINK. The alteration',
    'of the past is necessary for two reasons,',
    'one of which is subsidiary and, so to speak,',
    'precautionary. The subsidiary reason is that',
    'the Party member, like the proletarian, tolerates',
    'present-day conditions partly because he',
    'has no standards of comparison. He must be',
    'cut off from the past, just as he must be',
    'cut off from foreign countries, because it',
    'is necessary for him to believe that he is',
    'better off than his ancestors and that the',
    'average level of material comfort is constantly',
    'rising. But by far the more important reason',
    'for the readjustment of the past is the need',
    'to safeguard the infallibility of the Party.',
    'It is not merely that speeches, statistics,',
    'and records of every kind must be constantly',
    'brought up to date in order to show that',
    'the predictions of the Party were in all',
    'cases right. It is also that no change in',
    'doctrine or in political alignment can ever',
    'be admitted. For to change one\'s mind, or',
    'even one\'s policy, is a confession of weakness.',
    'If, for example, Eurasia or Eastasia (whichever',
    'it may be) is the enemy today, then that',
    'country must always have been the enemy.',
    'And if the facts say otherwise then the facts',
    'must be altered. Thus history is continuously',
    'rewritten. This day-to-day falsification',
    'of the past, carried out by the Ministry',
    'of Truth, is as necessary to the stability',
    'of the regime as the work of repression and',
    'espionage carried out by the Ministry of',
    'Love. The mutability of the past is the central',
    'tenet of Ingsoc. Past events, it is argued,',
    'have no objective existence, but survive',
    'only in written records and in human memories.',
    'The past is whatever the records and the',
    'memories agree upon. And since the Party',
    'is in full control of all records and in',
    'equally full control of the minds of its',
    'members, it follows that the past is whatever',
    'the Party chooses to make it. It also follows',
    'that though the past is alterable, it never',
    'has been altered in any specific instance.',
    'For when it has been recreated in whatever',
    'shape is needed at the moment, then this',
    'new version IS the past, and no different',
    'past can ever have existed. This holds good',
    'even when, as often happens, the same event',
    'has to be altered out of recognition several',
    'times in the course of a year. At all times',
    'the Party is in possession of absolute truth,',
    'and clearly the absolute can never have been',
    'different from what it is now. It will be',
    'seen that the control of the past depends',
    'above all on the training of memory. To make',
    'sure that all written records agree with',
    'the orthodoxy of the moment is merely a mechanical',
    'act. But it is also necessary to REMEMBER',
    'that events happened in the desired manner.',
    'And if it is necessary to rearrange one\'s',
    'memories or to tamper with written records,',
    'then it is necessary to FORGET that one has',
    'done so. The trick of doing this can be learned',
    'like any other mental technique. It is learned',
    'by the majority of Party members, and certainly',
    'by all who are intelligent as well as orthodox.',
    'In Oldspeak it is called, quite frankly,',
    '\'reality control\'. In Newspeak it is called',
    'DOUBLETHINK, though DOUBLETHINK comprises',
    'much else as well. DOUBLETHINK means the',
    'power of holding two contradictory beliefs',
    'in one\'s mind simultaneously, and accepting',
    'both of them. The Party intellectual knows',
    'in which direction his memories must be altered;',
    'he therefore knows that he is playing tricks',
    'with reality; but by the exercise of DOUBLETHINK',
    'he also satisfies himself that reality is',
    'not violated. The process has to be conscious,',
    'or it would not be carried out with sufficient',
    'precision, but it also has to be unconscious,',
    'or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity',
    'and hence of guilt. DOUBLETHINK lies at the',
    'very heart of Ingsoc, since the essential',
    'act of the Party is to use conscious deception',
    'while retaining the firmness of purpose that',
    'goes with complete honesty. To tell deliberate',
    'lies while genuinely believing in them, to',
    'forget any fact that has become inconvenient,',
    'and then, when it becomes necessary again,',
    'to draw it back from oblivion for just so',
    'long as it is needed, to deny the existence',
    'of objective reality and all the while to',
    'take account of the reality which one denies,',
    'all this is indispensably necessary. Even',
    'in using the word DOUBLETHINK it is necessary',
    'to exercise DOUBLETHINK. For by using the',
    'word one admits that one is tampering with',
    'reality; by a fresh act of DOUBLETHINK one',
    'erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely,',
    'with the lie always one leap ahead of the',
    'truth. Ultimately it is by means of DOUBLETHINK',
    'that the Party has been able, and may, for',
    'all we know, continue to be able for thousands',
    'of years, to arrest the course of history.',
    'All past oligarchies have fallen from power',
    'either because they ossified or because they',
    'grew soft. Either they became stupid and',
    'arrogant, failed to adjust themselves to',
    'changing circumstances, and were overthrown;',
    'or they became liberal and cowardly, made',
    'concessions when they should have used force,',
    'and once again were overthrown. They fell,',
    'that is to say, either through consciousness',
    'or through unconsciousness. It is the achievement',
    'of the Party to have produced a system of',
    'thought in which both conditions can exist',
    'simultaneously. And upon no other intellectual',
    'basis could the dominion of the Party be',
    'made permanent. If one is to rule, and to',
    'continue ruling, one must be able to dislocate',
    'the sense of reality. For the secret of rulership',
    'is to combine a belief in one\'s own infallibility',
    'with the Power to learn from past mistakes.',
    'It need hardly be said that the subtlest',
    'practitioners of DOUBLETHINK are those who',
    'invented DOUBLETHINK and know that it is',
    'a vast system of mental cheating. In our',
    'society, those who have the best knowledge',
    'of what is happening are also those who are',
    'furthest from seeing the world as it is.',
    'In general, the greater the understanding,',
    'the greater the delusion; the more intelligent,',
    'the less sane. One clear illustration of',
    'this is the fact that war hysteria increases',
    'in intensity as one rises in the social scale.',
    'Those whose attitude towards the war is most',
    'nearly rational are the subject peoples of',
    'the disputed territories. To these people',
    'the war is simply a continuous calamity which',
    'sweeps to and fro over their bodies like',
    'a tidal wave. Which side is winning is a',
    'matter of complete indifference to them.',
    'They are aware that a change of overlordship',
    'means simply that they will be doing the',
    'same work as before for new masters who treat',
    'them in the same manner as the old ones.',
    'The slightly more favoured workers whom we',
    'call \'the proles\' are only intermittently',
    'conscious of the war. When it is necessary',
    'they can be prodded into frenzies of fear',
    'and hatred, but when left to themselves they',
    'are capable of forgetting for long periods',
    'that the war is happening. It is in the ranks',
    'of the Party, and above all of the Inner',
    'Party, that the true war enthusiasm is found.',
    'World-conquest is believed in most firmly',
    'by those who know it to be impossible. This',
    'peculiar linking-together of opposites, knowledge',
    'with ignorance, cynicism with fanaticism,',
    'is one of the chief distinguishing marks',
    'of Oceanic society. The official ideology',
    'abounds with contradictions even when there',
    'is no practical reason for them. Thus, the',
    'Party rejects and vilifies every principle',
    'for which the Socialist movement originally',
    'stood, and it chooses to do this in the name',
    'of Socialism. It preaches a contempt for',
    'the working class unexampled for centuries',
    'past, and it dresses its members in a uniform',
    'which was at one time peculiar to manual',
    'workers and was adopted for that reason.',
    'It systematically undermines the solidarity',
    'of the family, and it calls its leader by',
    'a name which is a direct appeal to the sentiment',
    'of family loyalty. Even the names of the',
    'four Ministries by which we are governed',
    'exhibit a sort of impudence in their deliberate',
    'reversal of the facts. The Ministry of Peace',
    'concerns itself with war, the Ministry of',
    'Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with',
    'torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation.',
    'These contradictions are not accidental,',
    'nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy;',
    'they are deliberate exercises in DOUBLETHINK.',
    'For it is only by reconciling contradictions',
    'that power can be retained indefinitely.',
    'In no other way could the ancient cycle be',
    'broken. If human equality is to be for ever',
    'averted, if the High, as we have called them,',
    'are to keep their places permanently, then',
    'the prevailing mental condition must be controlled',
    'insanity. But there is one question which',
    'until this moment we have almost ignored.',
    'It is; WHY should human equality be averted?',
    'Supposing that the mechanics of the process',
    'have been rightly described, what is the',
    'motive for this huge, accurately planned',
    'effort to freeze history at a particular',
    'moment of time? Here we reach the central',
    'secret. As we have seen. the mystique of',
    'the Party, and above all of the Inner Party,',
    'depends upon DOUBLETHINK But deeper than',
    'this lies the original motive, the never-questioned',
    'instinct that first led to the seizure of',
    'power and brought DOUBLETHINK, the Thought',
    'Police, continuous warfare, and all the other',
    'necessary paraphernalia into existence afterwards.',
    'This motive really consists. Winston became',
    'aware of silence, as one becomes aware of',
    'a new sound. It seemed to him that Julia',
    'had been very still for some time past. She',
    'was lying on her side, naked from the waist',
    'upwards, with her cheek pillowed on her hand',
    'and one dark lock tumbling across her eyes.',
    'Her breast rose and fell slowly and regularly.',
    '\'Julia.\' No answer. \'Julia, are you awake?\'',
    'No answer. She was asleep. He shut the book,',
    'put it carefully on the floor, lay down,',
    'and pulled the coverlet over both of them.',
    'He had still, he reflected, not learned the',
    'ultimate secret. He understood HOW; he did',
    'not understand WHY. Chapter I, like Chapter',
    'III, had not actually told him anything that',
    'he did not know, it had merely systematized',
    'the knowledge that he possessed already.',
    'But after reading it he knew better than',
    'before that he was not mad. Being in a minority,',
    'even a minority of one, did not make you',
    'mad. There was truth and there was untruth,',
    'and if you clung to the truth even against',
    'the whole world, you were not mad. A yellow',
    'beam from the sinking sun slanted in through',
    'the window and fell across the pillow. He',
    'shut his eyes. The sun on his face and the',
    'girl\'s smooth body touching his own gave',
    'him a strong, sleepy, confident feeling.',
    'He was safe, everything was all right. He',
    'fell asleep murmuring \'Sanity is not statistical,\'',
    'with the feeling that this remark contained',
    'in it a profound wisdom. ***** When he woke',
    'it was with the sensation of having slept',
    'for a long time, but a glance at the old-fashioned',
    'clock told him that it was only twenty-thirty.',
    'He lay dozing for a while; then the usual',
    'deep-lunged singing struck up from the yard',
    'below: \'It was only an \'opeless fancy, It',
    'passed like an Ipril dye, But a look an\'',
    'a word an\' the dreams they stirred They \'ave',
    'stolen my \'eart awye!\' The drivelling song',
    'seemed to have kept its popularity. You still',
    'heard it all over the place. It had outlived',
    'the Hate Song. Julia woke at the sound, stretched',
    'herself luxuriously, and got out of bed.',
    '\'I\'m hungry,\' she said. \'Let\'s make some',
    'more coffee. Damn! The stove\'s gone out and',
    'the water\'s cold.\' She picked the stove up',
    'and shook it. \'There\'s no oil in it.\' \'We',
    'can get some from old Charrington, I expect.\'',
    '\'The funny thing is I made sure it was full.',
    'I\'m going to put my clothes on,\' she added.',
    '\'It seems to have got colder.\' Winston also',
    'got up and dressed himself. The indefatigable',
    'voice sang on: \'They sye that time \'eals',
    'all things, They sye you can always forget;',
    'But the smiles an\' the tears acrorss the',
    'years They twist my \'eart-strings yet!\' As',
    'he fastened the belt of his overalls he strolled',
    'across to the window. The sun must have gone',
    'down behind the houses; it was not shining',
    'into the yard any longer. The flagstones',
    'were wet as though they had just been washed,',
    'and he had the feeling that the sky had been',
    'washed too, so fresh and pale was the blue',
    'between the chimney-pots. Tirelessly the',
    'woman marched to and fro, corking and uncorking',
    'herself, singing and falling silent, and',
    'pegging out more diapers, and more and yet',
    'more. He wondered whether she took in washing',
    'for a living or was merely the slave of twenty',
    'or thirty grandchildren. Julia had come across',
    'to his side; together they gazed down with',
    'a sort of fascination at the sturdy figure',
    'below. As he looked at the woman in her characteristic',
    'attitude, her thick arms reaching up for',
    'the line, her powerful mare-like buttocks',
    'protruded, it struck him for the first time',
    'that she was beautiful. It had never before',
    'occurred to him that the body of a woman',
    'of fifty, blown up to monstrous dimensions',
    'by childbearing, then hardened, roughened',
    'by work till it was coarse in the grain like',
    'an over-ripe turnip, could be beautiful.',
    'But it was so, and after all, he thought,',
    'why not? The solid, contourless body, like',
    'a block of granite, and the rasping red skin,',
    'bore the same relation to the body of a girl',
    'as the rose-hip to the rose. Why should the',
    'fruit be held inferior to the flower? \'She\'s',
    'beautiful,\' he murmured. \'She\'s a metre across',
    'the hips, easily,\' said Julia. \'That is her',
    'style of beauty,\' said Winston. He held Julia\'s',
    'supple waist easily encircled by his arm.',
    'From the hip to the knee her flank was against',
    'his. Out of their bodies no child would ever',
    'come. That was the one thing they could never',
    'do. Only by word of mouth, from mind to mind,',
    'could they pass on the secret. The woman',
    'down there had no mind, she had only strong',
    'arms, a warm heart, and a fertile belly.',
    'He wondered how many children she had given',
    'birth to. It might easily be fifteen. She',
    'had had her momentary flowering, a year,',
    'perhaps, of wild-rose beauty and then she',
    'had suddenly swollen like a fertilized fruit',
    'and grown hard and red and coarse, and then',
    'her life had been laundering, scrubbing,',
    'darning, cooking, sweeping, polishing, mending,',
    'scrubbing, laundering, first for children,',
    'then for grandchildren, over thirty unbroken',
    'years. At the end of it she was still singing.',
    'The mystical reverence that he felt for her',
    'was somehow mixed up with the aspect of the',
    'pale, cloudless sky, stretching away behind',
    'the chimney-pots into interminable distance.',
    'It was curious to think that the sky was',
    'the same for everybody, in Eurasia or Eastasia',
    'as well as here. And the people under the',
    'sky were also very much the same, everywhere,',
    'all over the world, hundreds of thousands',
    'of millions of people just like this, people',
    'ignorant of one another\'s existence, held',
    'apart by walls of hatred and lies, and yet',
    'almost exactly the same, people who had never',
    'learned to think but who were storing up',
    'in their hearts and bellies and muscles the',
    'power that would one day overturn the world.',
    'If there was hope, it lay in the proles!',
    'Without having read to the end of THE BOOK,',
    'he knew that that must be Goldstein\'s final',
    'message. The future belonged to the proles.',
    'And could he be sure that when their time',
    'came the world they constructed would not',
    'be just as alien to him, Winston Smith, as',
    'the world of the Party? Yes, because at the',
    'least it would be a world of sanity. Where',
    'there is equality there can be sanity. Sooner',
    'or later it would happen, strength would',
    'change into consciousness. The proles were',
    'immortal, you could not doubt it when you',
    'looked at that valiant figure in the yard.',
    'In the end their awakening would come. And',
    'until that happened, though it might be a',
    'thousand years, they would stay alive against',
    'all the odds, like birds, passing on from',
    'body to body the vitality which the Party',
    'did not share and could not kill. \'Do you',
    'remember,\' he said, \'the thrush that sang',
    'to us, that first day, at the edge of the',
    'wood?\' \'He wasn\'t singing to us,\' said Julia.',
    '\'He was singing to please himself. Not even',
    'that. He was just singing.\' The birds sang,',
    'the proles sang. the Party did not sing.',
    'All round the world, in London and New York,',
    'in Africa and Brazil, and in the mysterious,',
    'forbidden lands beyond the frontiers, in',
    'the streets of Paris and Berlin, in the villages',
    'of the endless Russian plain, in the bazaars',
    'of China and Japan, everywhere stood the',
    'same solid unconquerable figure, made monstrous',
    'by work and childbearing, toiling from birth',
    'to death and still singing. Out of those',
    'mighty loins a race of conscious beings must',
    'one day come. You were the dead, theirs was',
    'the future. But you could share in that future',
    'if you kept alive the mind as they kept alive',
    'the body, and passed on the secret doctrine',
    'that two plus two make four. \'We are the',
    'dead,\' he said. \'We are the dead,\' echoed',
    'Julia dutifully. \'You are the dead,\' said',
    'an iron voice behind them. They sprang apart.',
    'Winston\'s entrails seemed to have turned',
    'into ice. He could see the white all round',
    'the irises of Julia\'s eyes. Her face had',
    'turned a milky yellow. The smear of rouge',
    'that was still on each cheekbone stood out',
    'sharply, almost as though unconnected with',
    'the skin beneath. \'You are the dead,\' repeated',
    'the iron voice. \'It was behind the picture,\'',
    'breathed Julia. \'It was behind the picture,\'',
    'said the voice. \'Remain exactly where you',
    'are. Make no movement until you are ordered.\'',
    'It was starting, it was starting at last!',
    'They could do nothing except stand gazing',
    'into one another\'s eyes. To run for life,',
    'to get out of the house before it was too',
    'late, no such thought occurred to them. Unthinkable',
    'to disobey the iron voice from the wall.',
    'There was a snap as though a catch had been',
    'turned back, and a crash of breaking glass.',
    'The picture had fallen to the floor uncovering',
    'the telescreen behind it. \'Now they can see',
    'us,\' said Julia. \'Now we can see you,\' said',
    'the voice. \'Stand out in the middle of the',
    'room. Stand back to back. Clasp your hands',
    'behind your heads. Do not touch one another.\'',
    'They were not touching, but it seemed to',
    'him that he could feel Julia\'s body shaking.',
    'Or perhaps it was merely the shaking of his',
    'own. He could just stop his teeth from chattering,',
    'but his knees were beyond his control. There',
    'was a sound of trampling boots below, inside',
    'the house and outside. The yard seemed to',
    'be full of men. Something was being dragged',
    'across the stones. The woman\'s singing had',
    'stopped abruptly. There was a long, rolling',
    'clang, as though the washtub had been flung',
    'across the yard, and then a confusion of',
    'angry shouts which ended in a yell of pain.',
    '\'The house is surrounded,\' said Winston.',
    '\'The house is surrounded,\' said the voice.',
    'He heard Julia snap her teeth together. \'I',
    'suppose we may as well say good-bye,\' she',
    'said. \'You may as well say good-bye,\' said',
    'the voice. And then another quite different',
    'voice, a thin, cultivated voice which Winston',
    'had the impression of having heard before,',
    'struck in; \'And by the way, while we are',
    'on the subject, "Here comes a candle to light',
    'you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop',
    'off your head"!\' Something crashed on to',
    'the bed behind Winston\'s back. The head of',
    'a ladder had been thrust through the window',
    'and had burst in the frame. Someone was climbing',
    'through the window. There was a stampede',
    'of boots up the stairs. The room was full',
    'of solid men in black uniforms, with iron-shod',
    'boots on their feet and truncheons in their',
    'hands. Winston was not trembling any longer.',
    'Even his eyes he barely moved. One thing',
    'alone mattered; to keep still, to keep still',
    'and not give them an excuse to hit you! A',
    'man with a smooth prize-fighter\'s jowl in',
    'which the mouth was only a slit paused opposite',
    'him balancing his truncheon meditatively',
    'between thumb and forefinger. Winston met',
    'his eyes. The feeling of nakedness, with',
    'one\'s hands behind one\'s head and one\'s face',
    'and body all exposed, was almost unbearable.',
    'The man protruded the tip of a white tongue,',
    'licked the place where his lips should have',
    'been, and then passed on. There was another',
    'crash. Someone had picked up the glass paperweight',
    'from the table and smashed it to pieces on',
    'the hearth-stone. The fragment of coral,',
    'a tiny crinkle of pink like a sugar rosebud',
    'from a cake, rolled across the mat. How small,',
    'thought Winston, how small it always was!',
    'There was a gasp and a thump behind him,',
    'and he received a violent kick on the ankle',
    'which nearly flung him off his balance. One',
    'of the men had smashed his fist into Julia\'s',
    'solar plexus, doubling her up like a pocket',
    'ruler. She was thrashing about on the floor,',
    'fighting for breath. Winston dared not turn',
    'his head even by a millimetre, but sometimes',
    'her livid, gasping face came within the angle',
    'of his vision. Even in his terror it was',
    'as though he could feel the pain in his own',
    'body, the deadly pain which nevertheless',
    'was less urgent than the struggle to get',
    'back her breath. He knew what it was like;',
    'the terrible, agonizing pain which was there',
    'all the while but could not be suffered yet,',
    'because before all else it was necessary',
    'to be able to breathe. Then two of the men',
    'hoisted her up by knees and shoulders, and',
    'carried her out of the room like a sack.',
    'Winston had a glimpse of her face, upside',
    'down, yellow and contorted, with the eyes',
    'shut, and still with a smear of rouge on',
    'either cheek; and that was the last he saw',
    'of her. He stood dead still. No one had hit',
    'him yet. Thoughts which came of their own',
    'accord but seemed totally uninteresting began',
    'to flit through his mind. He wondered whether',
    'they had got Mr Charrington. He wondered',
    'what they had done to the woman in the yard.',
    'He noticed that he badly wanted to urinate,',
    'and felt a faint surprise, because he had',
    'done so only two or three hours ago. He noticed',
    'that the clock on the mantelpiece said nine,',
    'meaning twenty-one. But the light seemed',
    'too strong. Would not the light be fading',
    'at twenty-one hours on an August evening?',
    'He wondered whether after all he and Julia',
    'had mistaken the time, had slept the clock',
    'round and thought it was twenty-thirty when',
    'really it was nought eight-thirty on the',
    'following morning. But he did not pursue',
    'the thought further. It was not interesting.',
    'There was another, lighter step in the passage.',
    'Mr Charrington came into the room. The demeanour',
    'of the black-uniformed men suddenly became',
    'more subdued. Something had also changed',
    'in Mr Charrington\'s appearance. His eye fell',
    'on the fragments of the glass paperweight.',
    '\'Pick up those pieces,\' he said sharply.',
    'A man stooped to obey. The cockney accent',
    'had disappeared; Winston suddenly realized',
    'whose voice it was that he had heard a few',
    'moments ago on the telescreen. Mr Charrington',
    'was still wearing his old velvet jacket,',
    'but his hair, which had been almost white,',
    'had turned black. Also he was not wearing',
    'his spectacles. He gave Winston a single',
    'sharp glance, as though verifying his identity,',
    'and then paid no more attention to him. He',
    'was still recognizable, but he was not the',
    'same person any longer. His body had straightened,',
    'and seemed to have grown bigger. His face',
    'had undergone only tiny changes that had',
    'nevertheless worked a complete transformation.',
    'The black eyebrows were less bushy, the wrinkles',
    'were gone, the whole lines of the face seemed',
    'to have altered; even the nose seemed shorter.',
    'It was the alert, cold face of a man of about',
    'five-and-thirty. It occurred to Winston that',
    'for the first time in his life he was looking,',
    'with knowledge, at a member of the Thought',
    'Police. PART THREE Chapter 1 He did not know',
    'where he was. Presumably he was in the Ministry',
    'of Love, but there was no way of making certain.',
    'He was in a high-ceilinged windowless cell',
    'with walls of glittering white porcelain.',
    'Concealed lamps flooded it with cold light,',
    'and there was a low, steady humming sound',
    'which he supposed had something to do with',
    'the air supply. A bench, or shelf, just wide',
    'enough to sit on ran round the wall, broken',
    'only by the door and, at the end opposite',
    'the door, a lavatory pan with no wooden seat.',
    'There were four telescreens, one in each',
    'wall. There was a dull aching in his belly.',
    'It had been there ever since they had bundled',
    'him into the closed van and driven him away.',
    'But he was also hungry, with a gnawing, unwholesome',
    'kind of hunger. It might be twenty-four hours',
    'since he had eaten, it might be thirty-six.',
    'He still did not know, probably never would',
    'know, whether it had been morning or evening',
    'when they arrested him. Since he was arrested',
    'he had not been fed. He sat as still as he',
    'could on the narrow bench, with his hands',
    'crossed on his knee. He had already learned',
    'to sit still. If you made unexpected movements',
    'they yelled at you from the telescreen. But',
    'the craving for food was growing upon him.',
    'What he longed for above all was a piece',
    'of bread. He had an idea that there were',
    'a few breadcrumbs in the pocket of his overalls.',
    'It was even possible, he thought this because',
    'from time to time something seemed to tickle',
    'his leg, that there might be a sizeable bit',
    'of crust there. In the end the temptation',
    'to find out overcame his fear; he slipped',
    'a hand into his pocket. \'Smith!\' yelled a',
    'voice from the telescreen. \'6079 Smith W.!',
    'Hands out of pockets in the cells!\' He sat',
    'still again, his hands crossed on his knee.',
    'Before being brought here he had been taken',
    'to another place which must have been an',
    'ordinary prison or a temporary lock-up used',
    'by the patrols. He did not know how long',
    'he had been there; some hours at any rate;',
    'with no clocks and no daylight it was hard',
    'to gauge the time. It was a noisy, evil-smelling',
    'place. They had put him into a cell similar',
    'to the one he was now in, but filthily dirty',
    'and at all times crowded by ten or fifteen',
    'people. The majority of them were common',
    'criminals, but there were a few political',
    'prisoners among them. He had sat silent against',
    'the wall, jostled by dirty bodies, too preoccupied',
    'by fear and the pain in his belly to take',
    'much interest in his surroundings, but still',
    'noticing the astonishing difference in demeanour',
    'between the Party prisoners and the others.',
    'The Party prisoners were always silent and',
    'terrified, but the ordinary criminals seemed',
    'to care nothing for anybody. They yelled',
    'insults at the guards, fought back fiercely',
    'when their belongings were impounded, wrote',
    'obscene words on the floor, ate smuggled',
    'food which they produced from mysterious',
    'hiding-places in their clothes, and even',
    'shouted down the telescreen when it tried',
    'to restore order. On the other hand some',
    'of them seemed to be on good terms with the',
    'guards, called them by nicknames, and tried',
    'to wheedle cigarettes through the spyhole',
    'in the door. The guards, too, treated the',
    'common criminals with a certain forbearance,',
    'even when they had to handle them roughly.',
    'There was much talk about the forced-labour',
    'camps to which most of the prisoners expected',
    'to be sent. It was \'all right\' in the camps,',
    'he gathered, so long as you had good contacts',
    'and knew the ropes. There was bribery, favouritism,',
    'and racketeering of every kind, there was',
    'homosexuality and prostitution, there was',
    'even illicit alcohol distilled from potatoes.',
    'The positions of trust were given only to',
    'the common criminals, especially the gangsters',
    'and the murderers, who formed a sort of aristocracy.',
    'All the dirty jobs were done by the politicals.',
    'There was a constant come-and-go of prisoners',
    'of every description: drug-peddlers, thieves,',
    'bandits, black-marketeers, drunks, prostitutes.',
    'Some of the drunks were so violent that the',
    'other prisoners had to combine to suppress',
    'them. An enormous wreck of a woman, aged',
    'about sixty, with great tumbling breasts',
    'and thick coils of white hair which had come',
    'down in her struggles, was carried in, kicking',
    'and shouting, by four guards, who had hold',
    'of her one at each corner. They wrenched',
    'off the boots with which she had been trying',
    'to kick them, and dumped her down across',
    'Winston\'s lap, almost breaking his thigh-bones.',
    'The woman hoisted herself upright and followed',
    'them out with a yell of \'F, ,  bastards!\'',
    'Then, noticing that she was sitting on something',
    'uneven, she slid off Winston\'s knees on to',
    'the bench. \'Beg pardon, dearie,\' she said.',
    '\'I wouldn\'t \'a sat on you, only the buggers',
    'put me there. They dono \'ow to treat a lady,',
    'do they?\' She paused, patted her breast,',
    'and belched. \'Pardon,\' she said, \'I ain\'t',
    'meself, quite.\' She leant forward and vomited',
    'copiously on the floor. \'Thass better,\' she',
    'said, leaning back with closed eyes. \'Never',
    'keep it down, thass what I say. Get it up',
    'while it\'s fresh on your stomach, like.\'',
    'She revived, turned to have another look',
    'at Winston and seemed immediately to take',
    'a fancy to him. She put a vast arm round',
    'his shoulder and drew him towards her, breathing',
    'beer and vomit into his face. \'Wass your',
    'name, dearie?\' she said. \'Smith,\' said Winston.',
    '\'Smith?\' said the woman. \'Thass funny. My',
    'name\'s Smith too. Why,\' she added sentimentally,',
    '\'I might be your mother!\' She might, thought',
    'Winston, be his mother. She was about the',
    'right age and physique, and it was probable',
    'that people changed somewhat after twenty',
    'years in a forced-labour camp. No one else',
    'had spoken to him. To a surprising extent',
    'the ordinary criminals ignored the Party',
    'prisoners. \'The polITS,\' they called them,',
    'with a sort of uninterested contempt. The',
    'Party prisoners seemed terrified of speaking',
    'to anybody, and above all of speaking to',
    'one another. Only once, when two Party members,',
    'both women, were pressed close together on',
    'the bench, he overheard amid the din of voices',
    'a few hurriedly-whispered words; and in particular',
    'a reference to something called \'room one-oh-one\',',
    'which he did not understand. It might be',
    'two or three hours ago that they had brought',
    'him here. The dull pain in his belly never',
    'went away, but sometimes it grew better and',
    'sometimes worse, and his thoughts expanded',
    'or contracted accordingly. When it grew worse',
    'he thought only of the pain itself, and of',
    'his desire for food. When it grew better,',
    'panic took hold of him. There were moments',
    'when he foresaw the things that would happen',
    'to him with such actuality that his heart',
    'galloped and his breath stopped. He felt',
    'the smash of truncheons on his elbows and',
    'iron-shod boots on his shins; he saw himself',
    'grovelling on the floor, screaming for mercy',
    'through broken teeth. He hardly thought of',
    'Julia. He could not fix his mind on her.',
    'He loved her and would not betray her; but',
    'that was only a fact, known as he knew the',
    'rules of arithmetic. He felt no love for',
    'her, and he hardly even wondered what was',
    'happening to her. He thought oftener of O\'Brien,',
    'with a flickering hope. O\'Brien might know',
    'that he had been arrested. The Brotherhood,',
    'he had said, never tried to save its members.',
    'But there was the razor blade; they would',
    'send the razor blade if they could. There',
    'would be perhaps five seconds before the',
    'guard could rush into the cell. The blade',
    'would bite into him with a sort of burning',
    'coldness, and even the fingers that held',
    'it would be cut to the bone. Everything came',
    'back to his sick body, which shrank trembling',
    'from the smallest pain. He was not certain',
    'that he would use the razor blade even if',
    'he got the chance. It was more natural to',
    'exist from moment to moment, accepting another',
    'ten minutes\' life even with the certainty',
    'that there was torture at the end of it.',
    'Sometimes he tried to calculate the number',
    'of porcelain bricks in the walls of the cell.',
    'It should have been easy, but he always lost',
    'count at some point or another. More often',
    'he wondered where he was, and what time of',
    'day it was. At one moment he felt certain',
    'that it was broad daylight outside, and at',
    'the next equally certain that it was pitch',
    'darkness. In this place, he knew instinctively,',
    'the lights would never be turned out. It',
    'was the place with no darkness: he saw now',
    'why O\'Brien had seemed to recognize the allusion.',
    'In the Ministry of Love there were no windows.',
    'His cell might be at the heart of the building',
    'or against its outer wall; it might be ten',
    'floors below ground, or thirty above it.',
    'He moved himself mentally from place to place,',
    'and tried to determine by the feeling of',
    'his body whether he was perched high in the',
    'air or buried deep underground. There was',
    'a sound of marching boots outside. The steel',
    'door opened with a clang. A young officer,',
    'a trim black-uniformed figure who seemed',
    'to glitter all over with polished leather,',
    'and whose pale, straight-featured face was',
    'like a wax mask, stepped smartly through',
    'the doorway. He motioned to the guards outside',
    'to bring in the prisoner they were leading.',
    'The poet Ampleforth shambled into the cell.',
    'The door clanged shut again. Ampleforth made',
    'one or two uncertain movements from side',
    'to side, as though having some idea that',
    'there was another door to go out of, and',
    'then began to wander up and down the cell.',
    'He had not yet noticed Winston\'s presence.',
    'His troubled eyes were gazing at the wall',
    'about a metre above the level of Winston\'s',
    'head. He was shoeless; large, dirty toes',
    'were sticking out of the holes in his socks.',
    'He was also several days away from a shave.',
    'A scrubby beard covered his face to the cheekbones,',
    'giving him an air of ruffianism that went',
    'oddly with his large weak frame and nervous',
    'movements. Winston roused himself a little',
    'from his lethargy. He must speak to Ampleforth,',
    'and risk the yell from the telescreen. It',
    'was even conceivable that Ampleforth was',
    'the bearer of the razor blade. \'Ampleforth,\'',
    'he said. There was no yell from the telescreen.',
    'Ampleforth paused, mildly startled. His eyes',
    'focused themselves slowly on Winston. \'Ah,',
    'Smith!\' he said. \'You too!\' \'What are you',
    'in for?\' \'To tell you the truth, \' He sat',
    'down awkwardly on the bench opposite Winston.',
    '\'There is only one offence, is there not?\'',
    'he said. \'And have you committed it?\' \'Apparently',
    'I have.\' He put a hand to his forehead and',
    'pressed his temples for a moment, as though',
    'trying to remember something. \'These things',
    'happen,\' he began vaguely. \'I have been able',
    'to recall one instance, a possible instance.',
    'It was an indiscretion, undoubtedly. We were',
    'producing a definitive edition of the poems',
    'of Kipling. I allowed the word "God" to remain',
    'at the end of a line. I could not help it!\'',
    'he added almost indignantly, raising his',
    'face to look at Winston. \'It was impossible',
    'to change the line. The rhyme was "rod".',
    'Do you realize that there are only twelve',
    'rhymes to "rod" in the entire language? For',
    'days I had racked my brains. There WAS no',
    'other rhyme.\' The expression on his face',
    'changed. The annoyance passed out of it and',
    'for a moment he looked almost pleased. A',
    'sort of intellectual warmth, the joy of the',
    'pedant who has found out some useless fact,',
    'shone through the dirt and scrubby hair.',
    '\'Has it ever occurred to you,\' he said, \'that',
    'the whole history of English poetry has been',
    'determined by the fact that the English language',
    'lacks rhymes?\' No, that particular thought',
    'had never occurred to Winston. Nor, in the',
    'circumstances, did it strike him as very',
    'important or interesting. \'Do you know what',
    'time of day it is?\' he said. Ampleforth looked',
    'startled again. \'I had hardly thought about',
    'it. They arrested me, it could be two days',
    'ago, perhaps three.\' His eyes flitted round',
    'the walls, as though he half expected to',
    'find a window somewhere. \'There is no difference',
    'between night and day in this place. I do',
    'not see how one can calculate the time.\'',
    'They talked desultorily for some minutes,',
    'then, without apparent reason, a yell from',
    'the telescreen bade them be silent. Winston',
    'sat quietly, his hands crossed. Ampleforth,',
    'too large to sit in comfort on the narrow',
    'bench, fidgeted from side to side, clasping',
    'his lank hands first round one knee, then',
    'round the other. The telescreen barked at',
    'him to keep still. Time passed. Twenty minutes,',
    'an hour, it was difficult to judge. Once',
    'more there was a sound of boots outside.',
    'Winston\'s entrails contracted. Soon, very',
    'soon, perhaps in five minutes, perhaps now,',
    'the tramp of boots would mean that his own',
    'turn had come. The door opened. The cold-faced',
    'young officer stepped into the cell. With',
    'a brief movement of the hand he indicated',
    'Ampleforth. \'Room 101,\' he said. Ampleforth',
    'marched clumsily out between the guards,',
    'his face vaguely perturbed, but uncomprehending.',
    'What seemed like a long time passed. The',
    'pain in Winston\'s belly had revived. His',
    'mind sagged round and round on the same trick,',
    'like a ball falling again and again into',
    'the same series of slots. He had only six',
    'thoughts. The pain in his belly; a piece',
    'of bread; the blood and the screaming; O\'Brien;',
    'Julia; the razor blade. There was another',
    'spasm in his entrails, the heavy boots were',
    'approaching. As the door opened, the wave',
    'of air that it created brought in a powerful',
    'smell of cold sweat. Parsons walked into',
    'the cell. He was wearing khaki shorts and',
    'a sports-shirt. This time Winston was startled',
    'into self-forgetfulness. \'YOU here!\' he said.',
    'Parsons gave Winston a glance in which there',
    'was neither interest nor surprise, but only',
    'misery. He began walking jerkily up and down,',
    'evidently unable to keep still. Each time',
    'he straightened his pudgy knees it was apparent',
    'that they were trembling. His eyes had a',
    'wide-open, staring look, as though he could',
    'not prevent himself from gazing at something',
    'in the middle distance. \'What are you in',
    'for?\' said Winston. \'Thoughtcrime!\' said',
    'Parsons, almost blubbering. The tone of his',
    'voice implied at once a complete admission',
    'of his guilt and a sort of incredulous horror',
    'that such a word could be applied to himself.',
    'He paused opposite Winston and began eagerly',
    'appealing to him: \'You don\'t think they\'ll',
    'shoot me, do you, old chap? They don\'t shoot',
    'you if you haven\'t actually done anything,',
    'only thoughts, which you can\'t help? I know',
    'they give you a fair hearing. Oh, I trust',
    'them for that! They\'ll know my record, won\'t',
    'they? YOU know what kind of chap I was. Not',
    'a bad chap in my way. Not brainy, of course,',
    'but keen. I tried to do my best for the Party,',
    'didn\'t I? I\'ll get off with five years, don\'t',
    'you think? Or even ten years? A chap like',
    'me could make himself pretty useful in a',
    'labour-camp. They wouldn\'t shoot me for going',
    'off the rails just once?\' \'Are you guilty?\'',
    'said Winston. \'Of course I\'m guilty!\' cried',
    'Parsons with a servile glance at the telescreen.',
    '\'You don\'t think the Party would arrest an',
    'innocent man, do you?\' His frog-like face',
    'grew calmer, and even took on a slightly',
    'sanctimonious expression. \'Thoughtcrime is',
    'a dreadful thing, old man,\' he said sententiously.',
    '\'It\'s insidious. It can get hold of you without',
    'your even knowing it. Do you know how it',
    'got hold of me? In my sleep! Yes, that\'s',
    'a fact. There I was, working away, trying',
    'to do my bit, never knew I had any bad stuff',
    'in my mind at all. And then I started talking',
    'in my sleep. Do you know what they heard',
    'me saying?\' He sank his voice, like someone',
    'who is obliged for medical reasons to utter',
    'an obscenity. \'"Down with Big Brother!" Yes,',
    'I said that! Said it over and over again,',
    'it seems. Between you and me, old man, I\'m',
    'glad they got me before it went any further.',
    'Do you know what I\'m going to say to them',
    'when I go up before the tribunal? "Thank',
    'you," I\'m going to say, "thank you for saving',
    'me before it was too late."\' \'Who denounced',
    'you?\' said Winston. \'It was my little daughter,\'',
    'said Parsons with a sort of doleful pride.',
    '\'She listened at the keyhole. Heard what',
    'I was saying, and nipped off to the patrols',
    'the very next day. Pretty smart for a nipper',
    'of seven, eh? I don\'t bear her any grudge',
    'for it. In fact I\'m proud of her. It shows',
    'I brought her up in the right spirit, anyway.\'',
    'He made a few more jerky movements up and',
    'down, several times, casting a longing glance',
    'at the lavatory pan. Then he suddenly ripped',
    'down his shorts. \'Excuse me, old man,\' he',
    'said. \'I can\'t help it. It\'s the waiting.\'',
    'He plumped his large posterior into the lavatory',
    'pan. Winston covered his face with his hands.',
    '\'Smith!\' yelled the voice from the telescreen.',
    '\'6079 Smith W.! Uncover your face. No faces',
    'covered in the cells.\' Winston uncovered',
    'his face. Parsons used the lavatory, loudly',
    'and abundantly. It then turned out that the',
    'plug was defective and the cell stank abominably',
    'for hours afterwards. Parsons was removed.',
    'More prisoners came and went, mysteriously.',
    'One, a woman, was consigned to \'Room 101\',',
    'and, Winston noticed, seemed to shrivel and',
    'turn a different colour when she heard the',
    'words. A time came when, if it had been morning',
    'when he was brought here, it would be afternoon;',
    'or if it had been afternoon, then it would',
    'be midnight. There were six prisoners in',
    'the cell, men and women. All sat very still.',
    'Opposite Winston there sat a man with a chinless,',
    'toothy face exactly like that of some large,',
    'harmless rodent. His fat, mottled cheeks',
    'were so pouched at the bottom that it was',
    'difficult not to believe that he had little',
    'stores of food tucked away there. His pale-grey',
    'eyes flitted timorously from face to face',
    'and turned quickly away again when he caught',
    'anyone\'s eye. The door opened, and another',
    'prisoner was brought in whose appearance',
    'sent a momentary chill through Winston. He',
    'was a commonplace, mean-looking man who might',
    'have been an engineer or technician of some',
    'kind. But what was startling was the emaciation',
    'of his face. It was like a skull. Because',
    'of its thinness the mouth and eyes looked',
    'disproportionately large, and the eyes seemed',
    'filled with a murderous, unappeasable hatred',
    'of somebody or something. The man sat down',
    'on the bench at a little distance from Winston.',
    'Winston did not look at him again, but the',
    'tormented, skull-like face was as vivid in',
    'his mind as though it had been straight in',
    'front of his eyes. Suddenly he realized what',
    'was the matter. The man was dying of starvation.',
    'The same thought seemed to occur almost simultaneously',
    'to everyone in the cell. There was a very',
    'faint stirring all the way round the bench.',
    'The eyes of the chinless man kept flitting',
    'towards the skull-faced man, then turning',
    'guiltily away, then being dragged back by',
    'an irresistible attraction. Presently he',
    'began to fidget on his seat. At last he stood',
    'up, waddled clumsily across the cell, dug',
    'down into the pocket of his overalls, and,',
    'with an abashed air, held out a grimy piece',
    'of bread to the skull-faced man. There was',
    'a furious, deafening roar from the telescreen.',
    'The chinless man jumped in his tracks. The',
    'skull-faced man had quickly thrust his hands',
    'behind his back, as though demonstrating',
    'to all the world that he refused the gift.',
    '\'Bumstead!\' roared the voice. \'2713 Bumstead',
    'J.! Let fall that piece of bread!\' The chinless',
    'man dropped the piece of bread on the floor.',
    '\'Remain standing where you are,\' said the',
    'voice. \'Face the door. Make no movement.\'',
    'The chinless man obeyed. His large pouchy',
    'cheeks were quivering uncontrollably. The',
    'door clanged open. As the young officer entered',
    'and stepped aside, there emerged from behind',
    'him a short stumpy guard with enormous arms',
    'and shoulders. He took his stand opposite',
    'the chinless man, and then, at a signal from',
    'the officer, let free a frightful blow, with',
    'all the weight of his body behind it, full',
    'in the chinless man\'s mouth. The force of',
    'it seemed almost to knock him clear of the',
    'floor. His body was flung across the cell',
    'and fetched up against the base of the lavatory',
    'seat. For a moment he lay as though stunned,',
    'with dark blood oozing from his mouth and',
    'nose. A very faint whimpering or squeaking,',
    'which seemed unconscious, came out of him.',
    'Then he rolled over and raised himself unsteadily',
    'on hands and knees. Amid a stream of blood',
    'and saliva, the two halves of a dental plate',
    'fell out of his mouth. The prisoners sat',
    'very still, their hands crossed on their',
    'knees. The chinless man climbed back into',
    'his place. Down one side of his face the',
    'flesh was darkening. His mouth had swollen',
    'into a shapeless cherry-coloured mass with',
    'a black hole in the middle of it. From time',
    'to time a little blood dripped on to the',
    'breast of his overalls. His grey eyes still',
    'flitted from face to face, more guiltily',
    'than ever, as though he were trying to discover',
    'how much the others despised him for his',
    'humiliation. The door opened. With a small',
    'gesture the officer indicated the skull-faced',
    'man. \'Room 101,\' he said. There was a gasp',
    'and a flurry at Winston\'s side. The man had',
    'actually flung himself on his knees on the',
    'floor, with his hand clasped together. \'Comrade!',
    'Officer!\' he cried. \'You don\'t have to take',
    'me to that place! Haven\'t I told you everything',
    'already? What else is it you want to know?',
    'There\'s nothing I wouldn\'t confess, nothing!',
    'Just tell me what it is and I\'ll confess',
    'straight off. Write it down and I\'ll sign',
    'it, anything! Not room 101!\' \'Room 101,\'',
    'said the officer. The man\'s face, already',
    'very pale, turned a colour Winston would',
    'not have believed possible. It was definitely,',
    'unmistakably, a shade of green. \'Do anything',
    'to me!\' he yelled. \'You\'ve been starving',
    'me for weeks. Finish it off and let me die.',
    'Shoot me. Hang me. Sentence me to twenty-five',
    'years. Is there somebody else you want me',
    'to give away? Just say who it is and I\'ll',
    'tell you anything you want. I don\'t care',
    'who it is or what you do to them. I\'ve got',
    'a wife and three children. The biggest of',
    'them isn\'t six years old. You can take the',
    'whole lot of them and cut their throats in',
    'front of my eyes, and I\'ll stand by and watch',
    'it. But not Room 101!\' \'Room 101,\' said the',
    'officer. The man looked frantically round',
    'at the other prisoners, as though with some',
    'idea that he could put another victim in',
    'his own place. His eyes settled on the smashed',
    'face of the chinless man. He flung out a',
    'lean arm. \'That\'s the one you ought to be',
    'taking, not me!\' he shouted. \'You didn\'t',
    'hear what he was saying after they bashed',
    'his face. Give me a chance and I\'ll tell',
    'you every word of it. HE\'S the one that\'s',
    'against the Party, not me.\' The guards stepped',
    'forward. The man\'s voice rose to a shriek.',
    '\'You didn\'t hear him!\' he repeated. \'Something',
    'went wrong with the telescreen. HE\'S the',
    'one you want. Take him, not me!\' The two',
    'sturdy guards had stooped to take him by',
    'the arms. But just at this moment he flung',
    'himself across the floor of the cell and',
    'grabbed one of the iron legs that supported',
    'the bench. He had set up a wordless howling,',
    'like an animal. The guards took hold of him',
    'to wrench him loose, but he clung on with',
    'astonishing strength. For perhaps twenty',
    'seconds they were hauling at him. The prisoners',
    'sat quiet, their hands crossed on their knees,',
    'looking straight in front of them. The howling',
    'stopped; the man had no breath left for anything',
    'except hanging on. Then there was a different',
    'kind of cry. A kick from a guard\'s boot had',
    'broken the fingers of one of his hands. They',
    'dragged him to his feet. \'Room 101,\' said',
    'the officer. The man was led out, walking',
    'unsteadily, with head sunken, nursing his',
    'crushed hand, all the fight had gone out',
    'of him. A long time passed. If it had been',
    'midnight when the skull-faced man was taken',
    'away, it was morning: if morning, it was',
    'afternoon. Winston was alone, and had been',
    'alone for hours. The pain of sitting on the',
    'narrow bench was such that often he got up',
    'and walked about, unreproved by the telescreen.',
    'The piece of bread still lay where the chinless',
    'man had dropped it. At the beginning it needed',
    'a hard effort not to look at it, but presently',
    'hunger gave way to thirst. His mouth was',
    'sticky and evil-tasting. The humming sound',
    'and the unvarying white light induced a sort',
    'of faintness, an empty feeling inside his',
    'head. He would get up because the ache in',
    'his bones was no longer bearable, and then',
    'would sit down again almost at once because',
    'he was too dizzy to make sure of staying',
    'on his feet. Whenever his physical sensations',
    'were a little under control the terror returned.',
    'Sometimes with a fading hope he thought of',
    'O\'Brien and the razor blade. It was thinkable',
    'that the razor blade might arrive concealed',
    'in his food, if he were ever fed. More dimly',
    'he thought of Julia. Somewhere or other she',
    'was suffering perhaps far worse than he.',
    'She might be screaming with pain at this',
    'moment. He thought: \'If I could save Julia',
    'by doubling my own pain, would I do it? Yes,',
    'I would.\' But that was merely an intellectual',
    'decision, taken because he knew that he ought',
    'to take it. He did not feel it. In this place',
    'you could not feel anything, except pain',
    'and foreknowledge of pain. Besides, was it',
    'possible, when you were actually suffering',
    'it, to wish for any reason that your own',
    'pain should increase? But that question was',
    'not answerable yet. The boots were approaching',
    'again. The door opened. O\'Brien came in.',
    'Winston started to his feet. The shock of',
    'the sight had driven all caution out of him.',
    'For the first time in many years he forgot',
    'the presence of the telescreen. \'They\'ve',
    'got you too!\' he cried. \'They got me a long',
    'time ago,\' said O\'Brien with a mild, almost',
    'regretful irony. He stepped aside. From behind',
    'him there emerged a broad-chested guard with',
    'a long black truncheon in his hand. \'You',
    'know this, Winston,\' said O\'Brien. \'Don\'t',
    'deceive yourself. You did know it, you have',
    'always known it.\' Yes, he saw now, he had',
    'always known it. But there was no time to',
    'think of that. All he had eyes for was the',
    'truncheon in the guard\'s hand. It might fall',
    'anywhere; on the crown, on the tip of the',
    'ear, on the upper arm, on the elbow, ,  The',
    'elbow! He had slumped to his knees, almost',
    'paralysed, clasping the stricken elbow with',
    'his other hand. Everything had exploded into',
    'yellow light. Inconceivable, inconceivable',
    'that one blow could cause such pain! The',
    'light cleared and he could see the other',
    'two looking down at him. The guard was laughing',
    'at his contortions. One question at any rate',
    'was answered. Never, for any reason on earth,',
    'could you wish for an increase of pain. Of',
    'pain you could wish only one thing: that',
    'it should stop. Nothing in the world was',
    'so bad as physical pain. In the face of pain',
    'there are no heroes, no heroes, he thought',
    'over and over as he writhed on the floor,',
    'clutching uselessly at his disabled left',
    'arm. Chapter 2 He was lying on something',
    'that felt like a camp bed, except that it',
    'was higher off the ground and that he was',
    'fixed down in some way so that he could not',
    'move. Light that seemed stronger than usual',
    'was falling on his face. O\'Brien was standing',
    'at his side, looking down at him intently.',
    'At the other side of him stood a man in a',
    'white coat, holding a hypodermic syringe.',
    'Even after his eyes were open he took in',
    'his surroundings only gradually. He had the',
    'impression of swimming up into this room',
    'from some quite different world, a sort of',
    'underwater world far beneath it. How long',
    'he had been down there he did not know. Since',
    'the moment when they arrested him he had',
    'not seen darkness or daylight. Besides, his',
    'memories were not continuous. There had been',
    'times when consciousness, even the sort of',
    'consciousness that one has in sleep, had',
    'stopped dead and started again after a blank',
    'interval. But whether the intervals were',
    'of days or weeks or only seconds, there was',
    'no way of knowing. With that first blow on',
    'the elbow the nightmare had started. Later',
    'he was to realize that all that then happened',
    'was merely a preliminary, a routine interrogation',
    'to which nearly all prisoners were subjected.',
    'There was a long range of crimes, espionage,',
    'sabotage, and the like, to which everyone',
    'had to confess as a matter of course. The',
    'confession was a formality, though the torture',
    'was real. How many times he had been beaten,',
    'how long the beatings had continued, he could',
    'not remember. Always there were five or six',
    'men in black uniforms at him simultaneously.',
    'Sometimes it was fists, sometimes it was',
    'truncheons, sometimes it was steel rods,',
    'sometimes it was boots. There were times',
    'when he rolled about the floor, as shameless',
    'as an animal, writhing his body this way',
    'and that in an endless, hopeless effort to',
    'dodge the kicks, and simply inviting more',
    'and yet more kicks, in his ribs, in his belly,',
    'on his elbows, on his shins, in his groin,',
    'in his testicles, on the bone at the base',
    'of his spine. There were times when it went',
    'on and on until the cruel, wicked, unforgivable',
    'thing seemed to him not that the guards continued',
    'to beat him but that he could not force himself',
    'into losing consciousness. There were times',
    'when his nerve so forsook him that he began',
    'shouting for mercy even before the beating',
    'began, when the mere sight of a fist drawn',
    'back for a blow was enough to make him pour',
    'forth a confession of real and imaginary',
    'crimes. There were other times when he started',
    'out with the resolve of confessing nothing,',
    'when every word had to be forced out of him',
    'between gasps of pain, and there were times',
    'when he feebly tried to compromise, when',
    'he said to himself: \'I will confess, but',
    'not yet. I must hold out till the pain becomes',
    'unbearable. Three more kicks, two more kicks,',
    'and then I will tell them what they want.\'',
    'Sometimes he was beaten till he could hardly',
    'stand, then flung like a sack of potatoes',
    'on to the stone floor of a cell, left to',
    'recuperate for a few hours, and then taken',
    'out and beaten again. There were also longer',
    'periods of recovery. He remembered them dimly,',
    'because they were spent chiefly in sleep',
    'or stupor. He remembered a cell with a plank',
    'bed, a sort of shelf sticking out from the',
    'wall, and a tin wash-basin, and meals of',
    'hot soup and bread and sometimes coffee.',
    'He remembered a surly barber arriving to',
    'scrape his chin and crop his hair, and businesslike,',
    'unsympathetic men in white coats feeling',
    'his pulse, tapping his reflexes, turning',
    'up his eyelids, running harsh fingers over',
    'him in search for broken bones, and shooting',
    'needles into his arm to make him sleep. The',
    'beatings grew less frequent, and became mainly',
    'a threat, a horror to which he could be sent',
    'back at any moment when his answers were',
    'unsatisfactory. His questioners now were',
    'not ruffians in black uniforms but Party',
    'intellectuals, little rotund men with quick',
    'movements and flashing spectacles, who worked',
    'on him in relays over periods which lasted,',
    'he thought, he could not be sure, ten or',
    'twelve hours at a stretch. These other questioners',
    'saw to it that he was in constant slight',
    'pain, but it was not chiefly pain that they',
    'relied on. They slapped his face, wrung his',
    'ears, pulled his hair, made him stand on',
    'one leg, refused him leave to urinate, shone',
    'glaring lights in his face until his eyes',
    'ran with water; but the aim of this was simply',
    'to humiliate him and destroy his power of',
    'arguing and reasoning. Their real weapon',
    'was the merciless questioning that went on',
    'and on, hour after hour, tripping him up,',
    'laying traps for him, twisting everything',
    'that he said, convicting him at every step',
    'of lies and self-contradiction until he began',
    'weeping as much from shame as from nervous',
    'fatigue. Sometimes he would weep half a dozen',
    'times in a single session. Most of the time',
    'they screamed abuse at him and threatened',
    'at every hesitation to deliver him over to',
    'the guards again; but sometimes they would',
    'suddenly change their tune, call him comrade,',
    'appeal to him in the name of Ingsoc and Big',
    'Brother, and ask him sorrowfully whether',
    'even now he had not enough loyalty to the',
    'Party left to make him wish to undo the evil',
    'he had done. When his nerves were in rags',
    'after hours of questioning, even this appeal',
    'could reduce him to snivelling tears. In',
    'the end the nagging voices broke him down',
    'more completely than the boots and fists',
    'of the guards. He became simply a mouth that',
    'uttered, a hand that signed, whatever was',
    'demanded of him. His sole concern was to',
    'find out what they wanted him to confess,',
    'and then confess it quickly, before the bullying',
    'started anew. He confessed to the assassination',
    'of eminent Party members, the distribution',
    'of seditious pamphlets, embezzlement of public',
    'funds, sale of military secrets, sabotage',
    'of every kind. He confessed that he had been',
    'a spy in the pay of the Eastasian government',
    'as far back as 1968. He confessed that he',
    'was a religious believer, an admirer of capitalism,',
    'and a sexual pervert. He confessed that he',
    'had murdered his wife, although he knew,',
    'and his questioners must have known, that',
    'his wife was still alive. He confessed that',
    'for years he had been in personal touch with',
    'Goldstein and had been a member of an underground',
    'organization which had included almost every',
    'human being he had ever known. It was easier',
    'to confess everything and implicate everybody.',
    'Besides, in a sense it was all true. It was',
    'true that he had been the enemy of the Party,',
    'and in the eyes of the Party there was no',
    'distinction between the thought and the deed.',
    'There were also memories of another kind.',
    'They stood out in his mind disconnectedly,',
    'like pictures with blackness all round them.',
    'He was in a cell which might have been either',
    'dark or light, because he could see nothing',
    'except a pair of eyes. Near at hand some',
    'kind of instrument was ticking slowly and',
    'regularly. The eyes grew larger and more',
    'luminous. Suddenly he floated out of his',
    'seat, dived into the eyes, and was swallowed',
    'up. He was strapped into a chair surrounded',
    'by dials, under dazzling lights. A man in',
    'a white coat was reading the dials. There',
    'was a tramp of heavy boots outside. The door',
    'clanged open. The waxed-faced officer marched',
    'in, followed by two guards. \'Room 101,\' said',
    'the officer. The man in the white coat did',
    'not turn round. He did not look at Winston',
    'either; he was looking only at the dials.',
    'He was rolling down a mighty corridor, a',
    'kilometre wide, full of glorious, golden',
    'light, roaring with laughter and shouting',
    'out confessions at the top of his voice.',
    'He was confessing everything, even the things',
    'he had succeeded in holding back under the',
    'torture. He was relating the entire history',
    'of his life to an audience who knew it already.',
    'With him were the guards, the other questioners,',
    'the men in white coats, O\'Brien, Julia, Mr',
    'Charrington, all rolling down the corridor',
    'together and shouting with laughter. Some',
    'dreadful thing which had lain embedded in',
    'the future had somehow been skipped over',
    'and had not happened. Everything was all',
    'right, there was no more pain, the last detail',
    'of his life was laid bare, understood, forgiven.',
    'He was starting up from the plank bed in',
    'the half-certainty that he had heard O\'Brien\'s',
    'voice. All through his interrogation, although',
    'he had never seen him, he had had the feeling',
    'that O\'Brien was at his elbow, just out of',
    'sight. It was O\'Brien who was directing everything.',
    'It was he who set the guards on to Winston',
    'and who prevented them from killing him.',
    'It was he who decided when Winston should',
    'scream with pain, when he should have a respite,',
    'when he should be fed, when he should sleep,',
    'when the drugs should be pumped into his',
    'arm. It was he who asked the questions and',
    'suggested the answers. He was the tormentor,',
    'he was the protector, he was the inquisitor,',
    'he was the friend. And once, Winston could',
    'not remember whether it was in drugged sleep,',
    'or in normal sleep, or even in a moment of',
    'wakefulness, a voice murmured in his ear:',
    '\'Don\'t worry, Winston; you are in my keeping.',
    'For seven years I have watched over you.',
    'Now the turning-point has come. I shall save',
    'you, I shall make you perfect.\' He was not',
    'sure whether it was O\'Brien\'s voice; but',
    'it was the same voice that had said to him,',
    '\'We shall meet in the place where there is',
    'no darkness,\' in that other dream, seven',
    'years ago. He did not remember any ending',
    'to his interrogation. There was a period',
    'of blackness and then the cell, or room,',
    'in which he now was had gradually materialized',
    'round him. He was almost flat on his back,',
    'and unable to move. His body was held down',
    'at every essential point. Even the back of',
    'his head was gripped in some manner. O\'Brien',
    'was looking down at him gravely and rather',
    'sadly. His face, seen from below, looked',
    'coarse and worn, with pouches under the eyes',
    'and tired lines from nose to chin. He was',
    'older than Winston had thought him; he was',
    'perhaps forty-eight or fifty. Under his hand',
    'there was a dial with a lever on top and',
    'figures running round the face. \'I told you,\'',
    'said O\'Brien, \'that if we met again it would',
    'be here.\' \'Yes,\' said Winston. Without any',
    'warning except a slight movement of O\'Brien\'s',
    'hand, a wave of pain flooded his body. It',
    'was a frightening pain, because he could',
    'not see what was happening, and he had the',
    'feeling that some mortal injury was being',
    'done to him. He did not know whether the',
    'thing was really happening, or whether the',
    'effect was electrically produced; but his',
    'body was being wrenched out of shape, the',
    'joints were being slowly torn apart. Although',
    'the pain had brought the sweat out on his',
    'forehead, the worst of all was the fear that',
    'his backbone was about to snap. He set his',
    'teeth and breathed hard through his nose,',
    'trying to keep silent as long as possible.',
    '\'You are afraid,\' said O\'Brien, watching',
    'his face, \'that in another moment something',
    'is going to break. Your especial fear is',
    'that it will be your backbone. You have a',
    'vivid mental picture of the vertebrae snapping',
    'apart and the spinal fluid dripping out of',
    'them. That is what you are thinking, is it',
    'not, Winston?\' Winston did not answer. O\'Brien',
    'drew back the lever on the dial. The wave',
    'of pain receded almost as quickly as it had',
    'come. \'That was forty,\' said O\'Brien. \'You',
    'can see that the numbers on this dial run',
    'up to a hundred. Will you please remember,',
    'throughout our conversation, that I have',
    'it in my power to inflict pain on you at',
    'any moment and to whatever degree I choose?',
    'If you tell me any lies, or attempt to prevaricate',
    'in any way, or even fall below your usual',
    'level of intelligence, you will cry out with',
    'pain, instantly. Do you understand that?\'',
    '\'Yes,\' said Winston. O\'Brien\'s manner became',
    'less severe. He resettled his spectacles',
    'thoughtfully, and took a pace or two up and',
    'down. When he spoke his voice was gentle',
    'and patient. He had the air of a doctor,',
    'a teacher, even a priest, anxious to explain',
    'and persuade rather than to punish. \'I am',
    'taking trouble with you, Winston,\' he said,',
    '\'because you are worth trouble. You know',
    'perfectly well what is the matter with you.',
    'You have known it for years, though you have',
    'fought against the knowledge. You are mentally',
    'deranged. You suffer from a defective memory.',
    'You are unable to remember real events and',
    'you persuade yourself that you remember other',
    'events which never happened. Fortunately',
    'it is curable. You have never cured yourself',
    'of it, because you did not choose to. There',
    'was a small effort of the will that you were',
    'not ready to make. Even now, I am well aware,',
    'you are clinging to your disease under the',
    'impression that it is a virtue. Now we will',
    'take an example. At this moment, which power',
    'is Oceania at war with?\' \'When I was arrested,',
    'Oceania was at war with Eastasia.\' \'With',
    'Eastasia. Good. And Oceania has always been',
    'at war with Eastasia, has it not?\' Winston',
    'drew in his breath. He opened his mouth to',
    'speak and then did not speak. He could not',
    'take his eyes away from the dial. \'The truth,',
    'please, Winston. YOUR truth. Tell me what',
    'you think you remember.\' \'I remember that',
    'until only a week before I was arrested,',
    'we were not at war with Eastasia at all.',
    'We were in alliance with them. The war was',
    'against Eurasia. That had lasted for four',
    'years. Before that, , \' O\'Brien stopped him',
    'with a movement of the hand. \'Another example,\'',
    'he said. \'Some years ago you had a very serious',
    'delusion indeed. You believed that three',
    'men, three one-time Party members named Jones,',
    'Aaronson, and Rutherford, men who were executed',
    'for treachery and sabotage after making the',
    'fullest possible confession, were not guilty',
    'of the crimes they were charged with. You',
    'believed that you had seen unmistakable documentary',
    'evidence proving that their confessions were',
    'false. There was a certain photograph about',
    'which you had a hallucination. You believed',
    'that you had actually held it in your hands.',
    'It was a photograph something like this.\'',
    'An oblong slip of newspaper had appeared',
    'between O\'Brien\'s fingers. For perhaps five',
    'seconds it was within the angle of Winston\'s',
    'vision. It was a photograph, and there was',
    'no question of its identity. It was THE photograph.',
    'It was another copy of the photograph of',
    'Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford at the party',
    'function in New York, which he had chanced',
    'upon eleven years ago and promptly destroyed.',
    'For only an instant it was before his eyes,',
    'then it was out of sight again. But he had',
    'seen it, unquestionably he had seen it! He',
    'made a desperate, agonizing effort to wrench',
    'the top half of his body free. It was impossible',
    'to move so much as a centimetre in any direction.',
    'For the moment he had even forgotten the',
    'dial. All he wanted was to hold the photograph',
    'in his fingers again, or at least to see',
    'it. \'It exists!\' he cried. \'No,\' said O\'Brien.',
    'He stepped across the room. There was a memory',
    'hole in the opposite wall. O\'Brien lifted',
    'the grating. Unseen, the frail slip of paper',
    'was whirling away on the current of warm',
    'air; it was vanishing in a flash of flame.',
    'O\'Brien turned away from the wall. \'Ashes,\'',
    'he said. \'Not even identifiable ashes. Dust.',
    'It does not exist. It never existed.\' \'But',
    'it did exist! It does exist! It exists in',
    'memory. I remember it. You remember it.\'',
    '\'I do not remember it,\' said O\'Brien. Winston\'s',
    'heart sank. That was doublethink. He had',
    'a feeling of deadly helplessness. If he could',
    'have been certain that O\'Brien was lying,',
    'it would not have seemed to matter. But it',
    'was perfectly possible that O\'Brien had really',
    'forgotten the photograph. And if so, then',
    'already he would have forgotten his denial',
    'of remembering it, and forgotten the act',
    'of forgetting. How could one be sure that',
    'it was simple trickery? Perhaps that lunatic',
    'dislocation in the mind could really happen:',
    'that was the thought that defeated him. O\'Brien',
    'was looking down at him speculatively. More',
    'than ever he had the air of a teacher taking',
    'pains with a wayward but promising child.',
    '\'There is a Party slogan dealing with the',
    'control of the past,\' he said. \'Repeat it,',
    'if you please.\' \'"Who controls the past controls',
    'the future: who controls the present controls',
    'the past,"\' repeated Winston obediently.',
    '\'"Who controls the present controls the past,"\'',
    'said O\'Brien, nodding his head with slow',
    'approval. \'Is it your opinion, Winston, that',
    'the past has real existence?\' Again the feeling',
    'of helplessness descended upon Winston. His',
    'eyes flitted towards the dial. He not only',
    'did not know whether \'yes\' or \'no\' was the',
    'answer that would save him from pain; he',
    'did not even know which answer he believed',
    'to be the true one. O\'Brien smiled faintly.',
    '\'You are no metaphysician, Winston,\' he said.',
    '\'Until this moment you had never considered',
    'what is meant by existence. I will put it',
    'more precisely. Does the past exist concretely,',
    'in space? Is there somewhere or other a place,',
    'a world of solid objects, where the past',
    'is still happening?\' \'No.\' \'Then where does',
    'the past exist, if at all?\' \'In records.',
    'It is written down.\' \'In records. And, ,',
    '?\' \'In the mind. In human memories.\' \'In',
    'memory. Very well, then. We, the Party, control',
    'all records, and we control all memories.',
    'Then we control the past, do we not?\' \'But',
    'how can you stop people remembering things?\'',
    'cried Winston again momentarily forgetting',
    'the dial. \'It is involuntary. It is outside',
    'oneself. How can you control memory? You',
    'have not controlled mine!\' O\'Brien\'s manner',
    'grew stern again. He laid his hand on the',
    'dial. \'On the contrary,\' he said, \'YOU have',
    'not controlled it. That is what has brought',
    'you here. You are here because you have failed',
    'in humility, in self-discipline. You would',
    'not make the act of submission which is the',
    'price of sanity. You preferred to be a lunatic,',
    'a minority of one. Only the disciplined mind',
    'can see reality, Winston. You believe that',
    'reality is something objective, external,',
    'existing in its own right. You also believe',
    'that the nature of reality is self-evident.',
    'When you delude yourself into thinking that',
    'you see something, you assume that everyone',
    'else sees the same thing as you. But I tell',
    'you, Winston, that reality is not external.',
    'Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere',
    'else. Not in the individual mind, which can',
    'make mistakes, and in any case soon perishes:',
    'only in the mind of the Party, which is collective',
    'and immortal. Whatever the Party holds to',
    'be the truth, is truth. It is impossible',
    'to see reality except by looking through',
    'the eyes of the Party. That is the fact that',
    'you have got to relearn, Winston. It needs',
    'an act of self-destruction, an effort of',
    'the will. You must humble yourself before',
    'you can become sane.\' He paused for a few',
    'moments, as though to allow what he had been',
    'saying to sink in. \'Do you remember,\' he',
    'went on, \'writing in your diary, "Freedom',
    'is the freedom to say that two plus two make',
    'four"?\' \'Yes,\' said Winston. O\'Brien held',
    'up his left hand, its back towards Winston,',
    'with the thumb hidden and the four fingers',
    'extended. \'How many fingers am I holding',
    'up, Winston?\' \'Four.\' \'And if the party says',
    'that it is not four but five, then how many?\'',
    '\'Four.\' The word ended in a gasp of pain.',
    'The needle of the dial had shot up to fifty-five.',
    'The sweat had sprung out all over Winston\'s',
    'body. The air tore into his lungs and issued',
    'again in deep groans which even by clenching',
    'his teeth he could not stop. O\'Brien watched',
    'him, the four fingers still extended. He',
    'drew back the lever. This time the pain was',
    'only slightly eased. \'How many fingers, Winston?\'',
    '\'Four.\' The needle went up to sixty. \'How',
    'many fingers, Winston?\' \'Four! Four! What',
    'else can I say? Four!\' The needle must have',
    'risen again, but he did not look at it. The',
    'heavy, stern face and the four fingers filled',
    'his vision. The fingers stood up before his',
    'eyes like pillars, enormous, blurry, and',
    'seeming to vibrate, but unmistakably four.',
    '\'How many fingers, Winston?\' \'Four! Stop',
    'it, stop it! How can you go on? Four! Four!\'',
    '\'How many fingers, Winston?\' \'Five! Five!',
    'Five!\' \'No, Winston, that is no use. You',
    'are lying. You still think there are four.',
    'How many fingers, please?\' \'Four! five! Four!',
    'Anything you like. Only stop it, stop the',
    'pain!\' Abruptly he was sitting up with O\'Brien\'s',
    'arm round his shoulders. He had perhaps lost',
    'consciousness for a few seconds. The bonds',
    'that had held his body down were loosened.',
    'He felt very cold, he was shaking uncontrollably,',
    'his teeth were chattering, the tears were',
    'rolling down his cheeks. For a moment he',
    'clung to O\'Brien like a baby, curiously comforted',
    'by the heavy arm round his shoulders. He',
    'had the feeling that O\'Brien was his protector,',
    'that the pain was something that came from',
    'outside, from some other source, and that',
    'it was O\'Brien who would save him from it.',
    '\'You are a slow learner, Winston,\' said O\'Brien',
    'gently. \'How can I help it?\' he blubbered.',
    '\'How can I help seeing what is in front of',
    'my eyes? Two and two are four.\' \'Sometimes,',
    'Winston. Sometimes they are five. Sometimes',
    'they are three. Sometimes they are all of',
    'them at once. You must try harder. It is',
    'not easy to become sane.\' He laid Winston',
    'down on the bed. The grip of his limbs tightened',
    'again, but the pain had ebbed away and the',
    'trembling had stopped, leaving him merely',
    'weak and cold. O\'Brien motioned with his',
    'head to the man in the white coat, who had',
    'stood immobile throughout the proceedings.',
    'The man in the white coat bent down and looked',
    'closely into Winston\'s eyes, felt his pulse,',
    'laid an ear against his chest, tapped here',
    'and there, then he nodded to O\'Brien. \'Again,\'',
    'said O\'Brien. The pain flowed into Winston\'s',
    'body. The needle must be at seventy, seventy-five.',
    'He had shut his eyes this time. He knew that',
    'the fingers were still there, and still four.',
    'All that mattered was somehow to stay alive',
    'until the spasm was over. He had ceased to',
    'notice whether he was crying out or not.',
    'The pain lessened again. He opened his eyes.',
    'O\'Brien had drawn back the lever. \'How many',
    'fingers, Winston?\' \'Four. I suppose there',
    'are four. I would see five if I could. I',
    'am trying to see five.\' \'Which do you wish:',
    'to persuade me that you see five, or really',
    'to see them?\' \'Really to see them.\' \'Again,\'',
    'said O\'Brien. Perhaps the needle was eighty,',
    'ninety. Winston could not intermittently',
    'remember why the pain was happening. Behind',
    'his screwed-up eyelids a forest of fingers',
    'seemed to be moving in a sort of dance, weaving',
    'in and out, disappearing behind one another',
    'and reappearing again. He was trying to count',
    'them, he could not remember why. He knew',
    'only that it was impossible to count them,',
    'and that this was somehow due to the mysterious',
    'identity between five and four. The pain',
    'died down again. When he opened his eyes',
    'it was to find that he was still seeing the',
    'same thing. Innumerable fingers, like moving',
    'trees, were still streaming past in either',
    'direction, crossing and recrossing. He shut',
    'his eyes again. \'How many fingers am I holding',
    'up, Winston?\' \'I don\'t know. I don\'t know.',
    'You will kill me if you do that again. Four,',
    'five, six, in all honesty I don\'t know.\'',
    '\'Better,\' said O\'Brien. A needle slid into',
    'Winston\'s arm. Almost in the same instant',
    'a blissful, healing warmth spread all through',
    'his body. The pain was already half-forgotten.',
    'He opened his eyes and looked up gratefully',
    'at O\'Brien. At sight of the heavy, lined',
    'face, so ugly and so intelligent, his heart',
    'seemed to turn over. If he could have moved',
    'he would have stretched out a hand and laid',
    'it on O\'Brien\'s arm. He had never loved him',
    'so deeply as at this moment, and not merely',
    'because he had stopped the pain. The old',
    'feeling, that at bottom it did not matter',
    'whether O\'Brien was a friend or an enemy,',
    'had come back. O\'Brien was a person who could',
    'be talked to. Perhaps one did not want to',
    'be loved so much as to be understood. O\'Brien',
    'had tortured him to the edge of lunacy, and',
    'in a little while, it was certain, he would',
    'send him to his death. It made no difference.',
    'In some sense that went deeper than friendship,',
    'they were intimates: somewhere or other,',
    'although the actual words might never be',
    'spoken, there was a place where they could',
    'meet and talk. O\'Brien was looking down at',
    'him with an expression which suggested that',
    'the same thought might be in his own mind.',
    'When he spoke it was in an easy, conversational',
    'tone. \'Do you know where you are, Winston?\'',
    'he said. \'I don\'t know. I can guess. In the',
    'Ministry of Love.\' \'Do you know how long',
    'you have been here?\' \'I don\'t know. Days,',
    'weeks, months, I think it is months.\' \'And',
    'why do you imagine that we bring people to',
    'this place?\' \'To make them confess.\' \'No,',
    'that is not the reason. Try again.\' \'To punish',
    'them.\' \'No!\' exclaimed O\'Brien. His voice',
    'had changed extraordinarily, and his face',
    'had suddenly become both stern and animated.',
    '\'No! Not merely to extract your confession,',
    'not to punish you. Shall I tell you why we',
    'have brought you here? To cure you! To make',
    'you sane! Will you understand, Winston, that',
    'no one whom we bring to this place ever leaves',
    'our hands uncured? We are not interested',
    'in those stupid crimes that you have committed.',
    'The Party is not interested in the overt',
    'act: the thought is all we care about. We',
    'do not merely destroy our enemies, we change',
    'them. Do you understand what I mean by that?\'',
    'He was bending over Winston. His face looked',
    'enormous because of its nearness, and hideously',
    'ugly because it was seen from below. Moreover',
    'it was filled with a sort of exaltation,',
    'a lunatic intensity. Again Winston\'s heart',
    'shrank. If it had been possible he would',
    'have cowered deeper into the bed. He felt',
    'certain that O\'Brien was about to twist the',
    'dial out of sheer wantonness. At this moment,',
    'however, O\'Brien turned away. He took a pace',
    'or two up and down. Then he continued less',
    'vehemently: \'The first thing for you to understand',
    'is that in this place there are no martyrdoms.',
    'You have read of the religious persecutions',
    'of the past. In the Middle Ages there was',
    'the Inquisition. It was a failure. It set',
    'out to eradicate heresy, and ended by perpetuating',
    'it. For every heretic it burned at the stake,',
    'thousands of others rose up. Why was that?',
    'Because the Inquisition killed its enemies',
    'in the open, and killed them while they were',
    'still unrepentant: in fact, it killed them',
    'because they were unrepentant. Men were dying',
    'because they would not abandon their true',
    'beliefs. Naturally all the glory belonged',
    'to the victim and all the shame to the Inquisitor',
    'who burned him. Later, in the twentieth century,',
    'there were the totalitarians, as they were',
    'called. There were the German Nazis and the',
    'Russian Communists. The Russians persecuted',
    'heresy more cruelly than the Inquisition',
    'had done. And they imagined that they had',
    'learned from the mistakes of the past; they',
    'knew, at any rate, that one must not make',
    'martyrs. Before they exposed their victims',
    'to public trial, they deliberately set themselves',
    'to destroy their dignity. They wore them',
    'down by torture and solitude until they were',
    'despicable, cringing wretches, confessing',
    'whatever was put into their mouths, covering',
    'themselves with abuse, accusing and sheltering',
    'behind one another, whimpering for mercy.',
    'And yet after only a few years the same thing',
    'had happened over again. The dead men had',
    'become martyrs and their degradation was',
    'forgotten. Once again, why was it? In the',
    'first place, because the confessions that',
    'they had made were obviously extorted and',
    'untrue. We do not make mistakes of that kind.',
    'All the confessions that are uttered here',
    'are true. We make them true. And above all',
    'we do not allow the dead to rise up against',
    'us. You must stop imagining that posterity',
    'will vindicate you, Winston. Posterity will',
    'never hear of you. You will be lifted clean',
    'out from the stream of history. We shall',
    'turn you into gas and pour you into the stratosphere.',
    'Nothing will remain of you, not a name in',
    'a register, not a memory in a living brain.',
    'You will be annihilated in the past as well',
    'as in the future. You will never have existed.\'',
    'Then why bother to torture me? thought Winston,',
    'with a momentary bitterness. O\'Brien checked',
    'his step as though Winston had uttered the',
    'thought aloud. His large ugly face came nearer,',
    'with the eyes a little narrowed. \'You are',
    'thinking,\' he said, \'that since we intend',
    'to destroy you utterly, so that nothing that',
    'you say or do can make the smallest difference,',
    'in that case, why do we go to the trouble',
    'of interrogating you first? That is what',
    'you were thinking, was it not?\' \'Yes,\' said',
    'Winston. O\'Brien smiled slightly. \'You are',
    'a flaw in the pattern, Winston. You are a',
    'stain that must be wiped out. Did I not tell',
    'you just now that we are different from the',
    'persecutors of the past? We are not content',
    'with negative obedience, nor even with the',
    'most abject submission. When finally you',
    'surrender to us, it must be of your own free',
    'will. We do not destroy the heretic because',
    'he resists us: so long as he resists us we',
    'never destroy him. We convert him, we capture',
    'his inner mind, we reshape him. We burn all',
    'evil and all illusion out of him; we bring',
    'him over to our side, not in appearance,',
    'but genuinely, heart and soul. We make him',
    'one of ourselves before we kill him. It is',
    'intolerable to us that an erroneous thought',
    'should exist anywhere in the world, however',
    'secret and powerless it may be. Even in the',
    'instant of death we cannot permit any deviation.',
    'In the old days the heretic walked to the',
    'stake still a heretic, proclaiming his heresy,',
    'exulting in it. Even the victim of the Russian',
    'purges could carry rebellion locked up in',
    'his skull as he walked down the passage waiting',
    'for the bullet. But we make the brain perfect',
    'before we blow it out. The command of the',
    'old despotisms was "Thou shalt not". The',
    'command of the totalitarians was "Thou shalt".',
    'Our command is "THOU ART". No one whom we',
    'bring to this place ever stands out against',
    'us. Everyone is washed clean. Even those',
    'three miserable traitors in whose innocence',
    'you once believed, Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford,',
    'in the end we broke them down. I took part',
    'in their interrogation myself. I saw them',
    'gradually worn down, whimpering, grovelling,',
    'weeping, and in the end it was not with pain',
    'or fear, only with penitence. By the time',
    'we had finished with them they were only',
    'the shells of men. There was nothing left',
    'in them except sorrow for what they had done,',
    'and love of Big Brother. It was touching',
    'to see how they loved him. They begged to',
    'be shot quickly, so that they could die while',
    'their minds were still clean.\' His voice',
    'had grown almost dreamy. The exaltation,',
    'the lunatic enthusiasm, was still in his',
    'face. He is not pretending, thought Winston,',
    'he is not a hypocrite, he believes every',
    'word he says. What most oppressed him was',
    'the consciousness of his own intellectual',
    'inferiority. He watched the heavy yet graceful',
    'form strolling to and fro, in and out of',
    'the range of his vision. O\'Brien was a being',
    'in all ways larger than himself. There was',
    'no idea that he had ever had, or could have,',
    'that O\'Brien had not long ago known, examined,',
    'and rejected. His mind CONTAINED Winston\'s',
    'mind. But in that case how could it be true',
    'that O\'Brien was mad? It must be he, Winston,',
    'who was mad. O\'Brien halted and looked down',
    'at him. His voice had grown stern again.',
    '\'Do not imagine that you will save yourself,',
    'Winston, however completely you surrender',
    'to us. No one who has once gone astray is',
    'ever spared. And even if we chose to let',
    'you live out the natural term of your life,',
    'still you would never escape from us. What',
    'happens to you here is for ever. Understand',
    'that in advance. We shall crush you down',
    'to the point from which there is no coming',
    'back. Things will happen to you from which',
    'you could not recover, if you lived a thousand',
    'years. Never again will you be capable of',
    'ordinary human feeling. Everything will be',
    'dead inside you. Never again will you be',
    'capable of love, or friendship, or joy of',
    'living, or laughter, or curiosity, or courage,',
    'or integrity. You will be hollow. We shall',
    'squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill',
    'you with ourselves.\' He paused and signed',
    'to the man in the white coat. Winston was',
    'aware of some heavy piece of apparatus being',
    'pushed into place behind his head. O\'Brien',
    'had sat down beside the bed, so that his',
    'face was almost on a level with Winston\'s.',
    '\'Three thousand,\' he said, speaking over',
    'Winston\'s head to the man in the white coat.',
    'Two soft pads, which felt slightly moist,',
    'clamped themselves against Winston\'s temples.',
    'He quailed. There was pain coming, a new',
    'kind of pain. O\'Brien laid a hand reassuringly,',
    'almost kindly, on his. \'This time it will',
    'not hurt,\' he said. \'Keep your eyes fixed',
    'on mine.\' At this moment there was a devastating',
    'explosion, or what seemed like an explosion,',
    'though it was not certain whether there was',
    'any noise. There was undoubtedly a blinding',
    'flash of light. Winston was not hurt, only',
    'prostrated. Although he had already been',
    'lying on his back when the thing happened,',
    'he had a curious feeling that he had been',
    'knocked into that position. A terrific painless',
    'blow had flattened him out. Also something',
    'had happened inside his head. As his eyes',
    'regained their focus he remembered who he',
    'was, and where he was, and recognized the',
    'face that was gazing into his own; but somewhere',
    'or other there was a large patch of emptiness,',
    'as though a piece had been taken out of his',
    'brain. \'It will not last,\' said O\'Brien.',
    '\'Look me in the eyes. What country is Oceania',
    'at war with?\' Winston thought. He knew what',
    'was meant by Oceania and that he himself',
    'was a citizen of Oceania. He also remembered',
    'Eurasia and Eastasia; but who was at war',
    'with whom he did not know. In fact he had',
    'not been aware that there was any war. \'I',
    'don\'t remember.\' \'Oceania is at war with',
    'Eastasia. Do you remember that now?\' \'Yes.\'',
    '\'Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia.',
    'Since the beginning of your life, since the',
    'beginning of the Party, since the beginning',
    'of history, the war has continued without',
    'a break, always the same war. Do you remember',
    'that?\' \'Yes.\' \'Eleven years ago you created',
    'a legend about three men who had been condemned',
    'to death for treachery. You pretended that',
    'you had seen a piece of paper which proved',
    'them innocent. No such piece of paper ever',
    'existed. You invented it, and later you grew',
    'to believe in it. You remember now the very',
    'moment at which you first invented it. Do',
    'you remember that?\' \'Yes.\' \'Just now I held',
    'up the fingers of my hand to you. You saw',
    'five fingers. Do you remember that?\' \'Yes.\'',
    'O\'Brien held up the fingers of his left hand,',
    'with the thumb concealed. \'There are five',
    'fingers there. Do you see five fingers?\'',
    '\'Yes.\' And he did see them, for a fleeting',
    'instant, before the scenery of his mind changed.',
    'He saw five fingers, and there was no deformity.',
    'Then everything was normal again, and the',
    'old fear, the hatred, and the bewilderment',
    'came crowding back again. But there had been',
    'a moment, he did not know how long, thirty',
    'seconds, perhaps, of luminous certainty,',
    'when each new suggestion of O\'Brien\'s had',
    'filled up a patch of emptiness and become',
    'absolute truth, and when two and two could',
    'have been three as easily as five, if that',
    'were what was needed. It had faded but before',
    'O\'Brien had dropped his hand; but though',
    'he could not recapture it, he could remember',
    'it, as one remembers a vivid experience at',
    'some period of one\'s life when one was in',
    'effect a different person. \'You see now,\'',
    'said O\'Brien, \'that it is at any rate possible.\'',
    '\'Yes,\' said Winston. O\'Brien stood up with',
    'a satisfied air. Over to his left Winston',
    'saw the man in the white coat break an ampoule',
    'and draw back the plunger of a syringe. O\'Brien',
    'turned to Winston with a smile. In almost',
    'the old manner he resettled his spectacles',
    'on his nose. \'Do you remember writing in',
    'your diary,\' he said, \'that it did not matter',
    'whether I was a friend or an enemy, since',
    'I was at least a person who understood you',
    'and could be talked to? You were right. I',
    'enjoy talking to you. Your mind appeals to',
    'me. It resembles my own mind except that',
    'you happen to be insane. Before we bring',
    'the session to an end you can ask me a few',
    'questions, if you choose.\' \'Any question',
    'I like?\' \'Anything.\' He saw that Winston\'s',
    'eyes were upon the dial. \'It is switched',
    'off. What is your first question?\' \'What',
    'have you done with Julia?\' said Winston.',
    'O\'Brien smiled again. \'She betrayed you,',
    'Winston. Immediately, unreservedly. I have',
    'seldom seen anyone come over to us so promptly.',
    'You would hardly recognize her if you saw',
    'her. All her rebelliousness, her deceit,',
    'her folly, her dirty-mindedness, everything',
    'has been burned out of her. It was a perfect',
    'conversion, a textbook case.\' \'You tortured',
    'her?\' O\'Brien left this unanswered. \'Next',
    'question,\' he said. \'Does Big Brother exist?\'',
    '\'Of course he exists. The Party exists. Big',
    'Brother is the embodiment of the Party.\'',
    '\'Does he exist in the same way as I exist?\'',
    '\'You do not exist,\' said O\'Brien. Once again',
    'the sense of helplessness assailed him. He',
    'knew, or he could imagine, the arguments',
    'which proved his own nonexistence; but they',
    'were nonsense, they were only a play on words.',
    'Did not the statement, \'You do not exist\',',
    'contain a logical absurdity? But what use',
    'was it to say so? His mind shrivelled as',
    'he thought of the unanswerable, mad arguments',
    'with which O\'Brien would demolish him. \'I',
    'think I exist,\' he said wearily. \'I am conscious',
    'of my own identity. I was born and I shall',
    'die. I have arms and legs. I occupy a particular',
    'point in space. No other solid object can',
    'occupy the same point simultaneously. In',
    'that sense, does Big Brother exist?\' \'It',
    'is of no importance. He exists.\' \'Will Big',
    'Brother ever die?\' \'Of course not. How could',
    'he die? Next question.\' \'Does the Brotherhood',
    'exist?\' \'That, Winston, you will never know.',
    'If we choose to set you free when we have',
    'finished with you, and if you live to be',
    'ninety years old, still you will never learn',
    'whether the answer to that question is Yes',
    'or No. As long as you live it will be an',
    'unsolved riddle in your mind.\' Winston lay',
    'silent. His breast rose and fell a little',
    'faster. He still had not asked the question',
    'that had come into his mind the first. He',
    'had got to ask it, and yet it was as though',
    'his tongue would not utter it. There was',
    'a trace of amusement in O\'Brien\'s face. Even',
    'his spectacles seemed to wear an ironical',
    'gleam. He knows, thought Winston suddenly,',
    'he knows what I am going to ask! At the thought',
    'the words burst out of him: \'What is in Room',
    '101?\' The expression on O\'Brien\'s face did',
    'not change. He answered drily: \'You know',
    'what is in Room 101, Winston. Everyone knows',
    'what is in Room 101.\' He raised a finger',
    'to the man in the white coat. Evidently the',
    'session was at an end. A needle jerked into',
    'Winston\'s arm. He sank almost instantly into',
    'deep sleep. Chapter 3 \'There are three stages',
    'in your reintegration,\' said O\'Brien. \'There',
    'is learning, there is understanding, and',
    'there is acceptance. It is time for you to',
    'enter upon the second stage.\' As always,',
    'Winston was lying flat on his back. But of',
    'late his bonds were looser. They still held',
    'him to the bed, but he could move his knees',
    'a little and could turn his head from side',
    'to side and raise his arms from the elbow.',
    'The dial, also, had grown to be less of a',
    'terror. He could evade its pangs if he was',
    'quick-witted enough: it was chiefly when',
    'he showed stupidity that O\'Brien pulled the',
    'lever. Sometimes they got through a whole',
    'session without use of the dial. He could',
    'not remember how many sessions there had',
    'been. The whole process seemed to stretch',
    'out over a long, indefinite time, weeks,',
    'possibly, and the intervals between the sessions',
    'might sometimes have been days, sometimes',
    'only an hour or two. \'As you lie there,\'',
    'said O\'Brien, \'you have often wondered, you',
    'have even asked me, why the Ministry of Love',
    'should expend so much time and trouble on',
    'you. And when you were free you were puzzled',
    'by what was essentially the same question.',
    'You could grasp the mechanics of the Society',
    'you lived in, but not its underlying motives.',
    'Do you remember writing in your diary, "I',
    'understand HOW: I do not understand WHY"?',
    'It was when you thought about "why" that',
    'you doubted your own sanity. You have read',
    'THE BOOK, Goldstein\'s book, or parts of it,',
    'at least. Did it tell you anything that you',
    'did not know already?\' \'You have read it?\'',
    'said Winston. \'I wrote it. That is to say,',
    'I collaborated in writing it. No book is',
    'produced individually, as you know.\' \'Is',
    'it true, what it says?\' \'As description,',
    'yes. The programme it sets forth is nonsense.',
    'The secret accumulation of knowledge, a gradual',
    'spread of enlightenment, ultimately a proletarian',
    'rebellion, the overthrow of the Party. You',
    'foresaw yourself that that was what it would',
    'say. It is all nonsense. The proletarians',
    'will never revolt, not in a thousand years',
    'or a million. They cannot. I do not have',
    'to tell you the reason: you know it already.',
    'If you have ever cherished any dreams of',
    'violent insurrection, you must abandon them.',
    'There is no way in which the Party can be',
    'overthrown. The rule of the Party is for',
    'ever. Make that the starting-point of your',
    'thoughts.\' He came closer to the bed. \'For',
    'ever!\' he repeated. \'And now let us get back',
    'to the question of "how" and "why". You understand',
    'well enough HOW the Party maintains itself',
    'in power. Now tell me WHY we cling to power.',
    'What is our motive? Why should we want power?',
    'Go on, speak,\' he added as Winston remained',
    'silent. Nevertheless Winston did not speak',
    'for another moment or two. A feeling of weariness',
    'had overwhelmed him. The faint, mad gleam',
    'of enthusiasm had come back into O\'Brien\'s',
    'face. He knew in advance what O\'Brien would',
    'say. That the Party did not seek power for',
    'its own ends, but only for the good of the',
    'majority. That it sought power because men',
    'in the mass were frail, cowardly creatures',
    'who could not endure liberty or face the',
    'truth, and must be ruled over and systematically',
    'deceived by others who were stronger than',
    'themselves. That the choice for mankind lay',
    'between freedom and happiness, and that,',
    'for the great bulk of mankind, happiness',
    'was better. That the party was the eternal',
    'guardian of the weak, a dedicated sect doing',
    'evil that good might come, sacrificing its',
    'own happiness to that of others. The terrible',
    'thing, thought Winston, the terrible thing',
    'was that when O\'Brien said this he would',
    'believe it. You could see it in his face.',
    'O\'Brien knew everything. A thousand times',
    'better than Winston he knew what the world',
    'was really like, in what degradation the',
    'mass of human beings lived and by what lies',
    'and barbarities the Party kept them there.',
    'He had understood it all, weighed it all,',
    'and it made no difference: all was justified',
    'by the ultimate purpose. What can you do,',
    'thought Winston, against the lunatic who',
    'is more intelligent than yourself, who gives',
    'your arguments a fair hearing and then simply',
    'persists in his lunacy? \'You are ruling over',
    'us for our own good,\' he said feebly. \'You',
    'believe that human beings are not fit to',
    'govern themselves, and therefore, , \' He',
    'started and almost cried out. A pang of pain',
    'had shot through his body. O\'Brien had pushed',
    'the lever of the dial up to thirty-five.',
    '\'That was stupid, Winston, stupid!\' he said.',
    '\'You should know better than to say a thing',
    'like that.\' He pulled the lever back and',
    'continued: \'Now I will tell you the answer',
    'to my question. It is this. The Party seeks',
    'power entirely for its own sake. We are not',
    'interested in the good of others; we are',
    'interested solely in power. Not wealth or',
    'luxury or long life or happiness: only power,',
    'pure power. What pure power means you will',
    'understand presently. We are different from',
    'all the oligarchies of the past, in that',
    'we know what we are doing. All the others,',
    'even those who resembled ourselves, were',
    'cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis',
    'and the Russian Communists came very close',
    'to us in their methods, but they never had',
    'the courage to recognize their own motives.',
    'They pretended, perhaps they even believed,',
    'that they had seized power unwillingly and',
    'for a limited time, and that just round the',
    'corner there lay a paradise where human beings',
    'would be free and equal. We are not like',
    'that. We know that no one ever seizes power',
    'with the intention of relinquishing it. Power',
    'is not a means, it is an end. One does not',
    'establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard',
    'a revolution; one makes the revolution in',
    'order to establish the dictatorship. The',
    'object of persecution is persecution. The',
    'object of torture is torture. The object',
    'of power is power. Now do you begin to understand',
    'me?\' Winston was struck, as he had been struck',
    'before, by the tiredness of O\'Brien\'s face.',
    'It was strong and fleshy and brutal, it was',
    'full of intelligence and a sort of controlled',
    'passion before which he felt himself helpless;',
    'but it was tired. There were pouches under',
    'the eyes, the skin sagged from the cheekbones.',
    'O\'Brien leaned over him, deliberately bringing',
    'the worn face nearer. \'You are thinking,\'',
    'he said, \'that my face is old and tired.',
    'You are thinking that I talk of power, and',
    'yet I am not even able to prevent the decay',
    'of my own body. Can you not understand, Winston,',
    'that the individual is only a cell? The weariness',
    'of the cell is the vigour of the organism.',
    'Do you die when you cut your fingernails?\'',
    'He turned away from the bed and began strolling',
    'up and down again, one hand in his pocket.',
    '\'We are the priests of power,\' he said. \'God',
    'is power. But at present power is only a',
    'word so far as you are concerned. It is time',
    'for you to gather some idea of what power',
    'means. The first thing you must realize is',
    'that power is collective. The individual',
    'only has power in so far as he ceases to',
    'be an individual. You know the Party slogan:',
    '"Freedom is Slavery". Has it ever occurred',
    'to you that it is reversible? Slavery is',
    'freedom. Alone, free, the human being is',
    'always defeated. It must be so, because every',
    'human being is doomed to die, which is the',
    'greatest of all failures. But if he can make',
    'complete, utter submission, if he can escape',
    'from his identity, if he can merge himself',
    'in the Party so that he IS the Party, then',
    'he is all-powerful and immortal. The second',
    'thing for you to realize is that power is',
    'power over human beings. Over the body, but,',
    'above all, over the mind. Power over matter,',
    'external reality, as you would call it, is',
    'not important. Already our control over matter',
    'is absolute.\' For a moment Winston ignored',
    'the dial. He made a violent effort to raise',
    'himself into a sitting position, and merely',
    'succeeded in wrenching his body painfully.',
    '\'But how can you control matter?\' he burst',
    'out. \'You don\'t even control the climate',
    'or the law of gravity. And there are disease,',
    'pain, death, , \' O\'Brien silenced him by',
    'a movement of his hand. \'We control matter',
    'because we control the mind. Reality is inside',
    'the skull. You will learn by degrees, Winston.',
    'There is nothing that we could not do. Invisibility,',
    'levitation, anything. I could float off this',
    'floor like a soap bubble if I wish to. I',
    'do not wish to, because the Party does not',
    'wish it. You must get rid of those nineteenth-century',
    'ideas about the laws of Nature. We make the',
    'laws of Nature.\' \'But you do not! You are',
    'not even masters of this planet. What about',
    'Eurasia and Eastasia? You have not conquered',
    'them yet.\' \'Unimportant. We shall conquer',
    'them when it suits us. And if we did not,',
    'what difference would it make? We can shut',
    'them out of existence. Oceania is the world.\'',
    '\'But the world itself is only a speck of',
    'dust. And man is tiny, helpless! How long',
    'has he been in existence? For millions of',
    'years the earth was uninhabited.\' \'Nonsense.',
    'The earth is as old as we are, no older.',
    'How could it be older? Nothing exists except',
    'through human consciousness.\' \'But the rocks',
    'are full of the bones of extinct animals,',
    'mammoths and mastodons and enormous reptiles',
    'which lived here long before man was ever',
    'heard of.\' \'Have you ever seen those bones,',
    'Winston? Of course not. Nineteenth-century',
    'biologists invented them. Before man there',
    'was nothing. After man, if he could come',
    'to an end, there would be nothing. Outside',
    'man there is nothing.\' \'But the whole universe',
    'is outside us. Look at the stars! Some of',
    'them are a million light-years away. They',
    'are out of our reach for ever.\' \'What are',
    'the stars?\' said O\'Brien indifferently. \'They',
    'are bits of fire a few kilometres away. We',
    'could reach them if we wanted to. Or we could',
    'blot them out. The earth is the centre of',
    'the universe. The sun and the stars go round',
    'it.\' Winston made another convulsive movement.',
    'This time he did not say anything. O\'Brien',
    'continued as though answering a spoken objection:',
    '\'For certain purposes, of course, that is',
    'not true. When we navigate the ocean, or',
    'when we predict an eclipse, we often find',
    'it convenient to assume that the earth goes',
    'round the sun and that the stars are millions',
    'upon millions of kilometres away. But what',
    'of it? Do you suppose it is beyond us to',
    'produce a dual system of astronomy? The stars',
    'can be near or distant, according as we need',
    'them. Do you suppose our mathematicians are',
    'unequal to that? Have you forgotten doublethink?\'',
    'Winston shrank back upon the bed. Whatever',
    'he said, the swift answer crushed him like',
    'a bludgeon. And yet he knew, he KNEW, that',
    'he was in the right. The belief that nothing',
    'exists outside your own mind, surely there',
    'must be some way of demonstrating that it',
    'was false? Had it not been exposed long ago',
    'as a fallacy? There was even a name for it,',
    'which he had forgotten. A faint smile twitched',
    'the corners of O\'Brien\'s mouth as he looked',
    'down at him. \'I told you, Winston,\' he said,',
    '\'that metaphysics is not your strong point.',
    'The word you are trying to think of is solipsism.',
    'But you are mistaken. This is not solipsism.',
    'Collective solipsism, if you like. But that',
    'is a different thing: in fact, the opposite',
    'thing. All this is a digression,\' he added',
    'in a different tone. \'The real power, the',
    'power we have to fight for night and day,',
    'is not power over things, but over men.\'',
    'He paused, and for a moment assumed again',
    'his air of a schoolmaster questioning a promising',
    'pupil: \'How does one man assert his power',
    'over another, Winston?\' Winston thought.',
    '\'By making him suffer,\' he said. \'Exactly.',
    'By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough.',
    'Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure',
    'that he is obeying your will and not his',
    'own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation.',
    'Power is in tearing human minds to pieces',
    'and putting them together again in new shapes',
    'of your own choosing. Do you begin to see,',
    'then, what kind of world we are creating?',
    'It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic',
    'Utopias that the old reformers imagined.',
    'A world of fear and treachery and torment,',
    'a world of trampling and being trampled upon,',
    'a world which will grow not less but MORE',
    'merciless as it refines itself. Progress',
    'in our world will be progress towards more',
    'pain. The old civilizations claimed that',
    'they were founded on love or justice. Ours',
    'is founded upon hatred. In our world there',
    'will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph,',
    'and self-abasement. Everything else we shall',
    'destroy, everything. Already we are breaking',
    'down the habits of thought which have survived',
    'from before the Revolution. We have cut the',
    'links between child and parent, and between',
    'man and man, and between man and woman. No',
    'one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend',
    'any longer. But in the future there will',
    'be no wives and no friends. Children will',
    'be taken from their mothers at birth, as',
    'one takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct',
    'will be eradicated. Procreation will be an',
    'annual formality like the renewal of a ration',
    'card. We shall abolish the orgasm. Our neurologists',
    'are at work upon it now. There will be no',
    'loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party.',
    'There will be no love, except the love of',
    'Big Brother. There will be no laughter, except',
    'the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy.',
    'There will be no art, no literature, no science.',
    'When we are omnipotent we shall have no more',
    'need of science. There will be no distinction',
    'between beauty and ugliness. There will be',
    'no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process',
    'of life. All competing pleasures will be',
    'destroyed. But always, do not forget this,',
    'Winston, always there will be the intoxication',
    'of power, constantly increasing and constantly',
    'growing subtler. Always, at every moment,',
    'there will be the thrill of victory, the',
    'sensation of trampling on an enemy who is',
    'helpless. If you want a picture of the future,',
    'imagine a boot stamping on a human face,',
    'for ever.\' He paused as though he expected',
    'Winston to speak. Winston had tried to shrink',
    'back into the surface of the bed again. He',
    'could not say anything. His heart seemed',
    'to be frozen. O\'Brien went on: \'And remember',
    'that it is for ever. The face will always',
    'be there to be stamped upon. The heretic,',
    'the enemy of society, will always be there,',
    'so that he can be defeated and humiliated',
    'over again. Everything that you have undergone',
    'since you have been in our hands, all that',
    'will continue, and worse. The espionage,',
    'the betrayals, the arrests, the tortures,',
    'the executions, the disappearances will never',
    'cease. It will be a world of terror as much',
    'as a world of triumph. The more the Party',
    'is powerful, the less it will be tolerant:',
    'the weaker the opposition, the tighter the',
    'despotism. Goldstein and his heresies will',
    'live for ever. Every day, at every moment,',
    'they will be defeated, discredited, ridiculed,',
    'spat upon and yet they will always survive.',
    'This drama that I have played out with you',
    'during seven years will be played out over',
    'and over again generation after generation,',
    'always in subtler forms. Always we shall',
    'have the heretic here at our mercy, screaming',
    'with pain, broken up, contemptible, and in',
    'the end utterly penitent, saved from himself,',
    'crawling to our feet of his own accord. That',
    'is the world that we are preparing, Winston.',
    'A world of victory after victory, triumph',
    'after triumph after triumph: an endless pressing,',
    'pressing, pressing upon the nerve of power.',
    'You are beginning, I can see, to realize',
    'what that world will be like. But in the',
    'end you will do more than understand it.',
    'You will accept it, welcome it, become part',
    'of it.\' Winston had recovered himself sufficiently',
    'to speak. \'You can\'t!\' he said weakly. \'What',
    'do you mean by that remark, Winston?\' \'You',
    'could not create such a world as you have',
    'just described. It is a dream. It is impossible.\'',
    '\'Why?\' \'It is impossible to found a civilization',
    'on fear and hatred and cruelty. It would',
    'never endure.\' \'Why not?\' \'It would have',
    'no vitality. It would disintegrate. It would',
    'commit suicide.\' \'Nonsense. You are under',
    'the impression that hatred is more exhausting',
    'than love. Why should it be? And if it were,',
    'what difference would that make? Suppose',
    'that we choose to wear ourselves out faster.',
    'Suppose that we quicken the tempo of human',
    'life till men are senile at thirty. Still',
    'what difference would it make? Can you not',
    'understand that the death of the individual',
    'is not death? The party is immortal.\' As',
    'usual, the voice had battered Winston into',
    'helplessness. Moreover he was in dread that',
    'if he persisted in his disagreement O\'Brien',
    'would twist the dial again. And yet he could',
    'not keep silent. Feebly, without arguments,',
    'with nothing to support him except his inarticulate',
    'horror of what O\'Brien had said, he returned',
    'to the attack. \'I don\'t know, I don\'t care.',
    'Somehow you will fail. Something will defeat',
    'you. Life will defeat you.\' \'We control life,',
    'Winston, at all its levels. You are imagining',
    'that there is something called human nature',
    'which will be outraged by what we do and',
    'will turn against us. But we create human',
    'nature. Men are infinitely malleable. Or',
    'perhaps you have returned to your old idea',
    'that the proletarians or the slaves will',
    'arise and overthrow us. Put it out of your',
    'mind. They are helpless, like the animals.',
    'Humanity is the Party. The others are outside,',
    'irrelevant.\' \'I don\'t care. In the end they',
    'will beat you. Sooner or later they will',
    'see you for what you are, and then they will',
    'tear you to pieces.\' \'Do you see any evidence',
    'that that is happening? Or any reason why',
    'it should?\' \'No. I believe it. I KNOW that',
    'you will fail. There is something in the',
    'universe, I don\'t know, some spirit, some',
    'principle, that you will never overcome.\'',
    '\'Do you believe in God, Winston?\' \'No.\' \'Then',
    'what is it, this principle that will defeat',
    'us?\' \'I don\'t know. The spirit of Man.\' \'And',
    'do you consider yourself a man?\' \'Yes.\' \'If',
    'you are a man, Winston, you are the last',
    'man. Your kind is extinct; we are the inheritors.',
    'Do you understand that you are ALONE? You',
    'are outside history, you are non-existent.\'',
    'His manner changed and he said more harshly:',
    '\'And you consider yourself morally superior',
    'to us, with our lies and our cruelty?\' \'Yes,',
    'I consider myself superior.\' O\'Brien did',
    'not speak. Two other voices were speaking.',
    'After a moment Winston recognized one of',
    'them as his own. It was a sound-track of',
    'the conversation he had had with O\'Brien,',
    'on the night when he had enrolled himself',
    'in the Brotherhood. He heard himself promising',
    'to lie, to steal, to forge, to murder, to',
    'encourage drug-taking and prostitution, to',
    'disseminate venereal diseases, to throw vitriol',
    'in a child\'s face. O\'Brien made a small impatient',
    'gesture, as though to say that the demonstration',
    'was hardly worth making. Then he turned a',
    'switch and the voices stopped. \'Get up from',
    'that bed,\' he said. The bonds had loosened',
    'themselves. Winston lowered himself to the',
    'floor and stood up unsteadily. \'You are the',
    'last man,\' said O\'Brien. \'You are the guardian',
    'of the human spirit. You shall see yourself',
    'as you are. Take off your clothes.\' Winston',
    'undid the bit of string that held his overalls',
    'together. The zip fastener had long since',
    'been wrenched out of them. He could not remember',
    'whether at any time since his arrest he had',
    'taken off all his clothes at one time. Beneath',
    'the overalls his body was looped with filthy',
    'yellowish rags, just recognizable as the',
    'remnants of underclothes. As he slid them',
    'to the ground he saw that there was a three-sided',
    'mirror at the far end of the room. He approached',
    'it, then stopped short. An involuntary cry',
    'had broken out of him. \'Go on,\' said O\'Brien.',
    '\'Stand between the wings of the mirror. You',
    'shall see the side view as well.\' He had',
    'stopped because he was frightened. A bowed,',
    'grey-coloured, skeleton-like thing was coming',
    'towards him. Its actual appearance was frightening,',
    'and not merely the fact that he knew it to',
    'be himself. He moved closer to the glass.',
    'The creature\'s face seemed to be protruded,',
    'because of its bent carriage. A forlorn,',
    'jailbird\'s face with a nobby forehead running',
    'back into a bald scalp, a crooked nose, and',
    'battered-looking cheekbones above which his',
    'eyes were fierce and watchful. The cheeks',
    'were seamed, the mouth had a drawn-in look.',
    'Certainly it was his own face, but it seemed',
    'to him that it had changed more than he had',
    'changed inside. The emotions it registered',
    'would be different from the ones he felt.',
    'He had gone partially bald. For the first',
    'moment he had thought that he had gone grey',
    'as well, but it was only the scalp that was',
    'grey. Except for his hands and a circle of',
    'his face, his body was grey all over with',
    'ancient, ingrained dirt. Here and there under',
    'the dirt there were the red scars of wounds,',
    'and near the ankle the varicose ulcer was',
    'an inflamed mass with flakes of skin peeling',
    'off it. But the truly frightening thing was',
    'the emaciation of his body. The barrel of',
    'the ribs was as narrow as that of a skeleton:',
    'the legs had shrunk so that the knees were',
    'thicker than the thighs. He saw now what',
    'O\'Brien had meant about seeing the side view.',
    'The curvature of the spine was astonishing.',
    'The thin shoulders were hunched forward so',
    'as to make a cavity of the chest, the scraggy',
    'neck seemed to be bending double under the',
    'weight of the skull. At a guess he would',
    'have said that it was the body of a man of',
    'sixty, suffering from some malignant disease.',
    '\'You have thought sometimes,\' said O\'Brien,',
    '\'that my face, the face of a member of the',
    'Inner Party, looks old and worn. What do',
    'you think of your own face?\' He seized Winston\'s',
    'shoulder and spun him round so that he was',
    'facing him. \'Look at the condition you are',
    'in!\' he said. \'Look at this filthy grime',
    'all over your body. Look at the dirt between',
    'your toes. Look at that disgusting running',
    'sore on your leg. Do you know that you stink',
    'like a goat? Probably you have ceased to',
    'notice it. Look at your emaciation. Do you',
    'see? I can make my thumb and forefinger meet',
    'round your bicep. I could snap your neck',
    'like a carrot. Do you know that you have',
    'lost twenty-five kilograms since you have',
    'been in our hands? Even your hair is coming',
    'out in handfuls. Look!\' He plucked at Winston\'s',
    'head and brought away a tuft of hair. \'Open',
    'your mouth. Nine, ten, eleven teeth left.',
    'How many had you when you came to us? And',
    'the few you have left are dropping out of',
    'your head. Look here!\' He seized one of Winston\'s',
    'remaining front teeth between his powerful',
    'thumb and forefinger. A twinge of pain shot',
    'through Winston\'s jaw. O\'Brien had wrenched',
    'the loose tooth out by the roots. He tossed',
    'it across the cell. \'You are rotting away,\'',
    'he said; \'you are falling to pieces. What',
    'are you? A bag of filth. Now turn around',
    'and look into that mirror again. Do you see',
    'that thing facing you? That is the last man.',
    'If you are human, that is humanity. Now put',
    'your clothes on again.\' Winston began to',
    'dress himself with slow stiff movements.',
    'Until now he had not seemed to notice how',
    'thin and weak he was. Only one thought stirred',
    'in his mind: that he must have been in this',
    'place longer than he had imagined. Then suddenly',
    'as he fixed the miserable rags round himself',
    'a feeling of pity for his ruined body overcame',
    'him. Before he knew what he was doing he',
    'had collapsed on to a small stool that stood',
    'beside the bed and burst into tears. He was',
    'aware of his ugliness, his gracelessness,',
    'a bundle of bones in filthy underclothes',
    'sitting weeping in the harsh white light:',
    'but he could not stop himself. O\'Brien laid',
    'a hand on his shoulder, almost kindly. \'It',
    'will not last for ever,\' he said. \'You can',
    'escape from it whenever you choose. Everything',
    'depends on yourself.\' \'You did it!\' sobbed',
    'Winston. \'You reduced me to this state.\'',
    '\'No, Winston, you reduced yourself to it.',
    'This is what you accepted when you set yourself',
    'up against the Party. It was all contained',
    'in that first act. Nothing has happened that',
    'you did not foresee.\' He paused, and then',
    'went on: \'We have beaten you, Winston. We',
    'have broken you up. You have seen what your',
    'body is like. Your mind is in the same state.',
    'I do not think there can be much pride left',
    'in you. You have been kicked and flogged',
    'and insulted, you have screamed with pain,',
    'you have rolled on the floor in your own',
    'blood and vomit. You have whimpered for mercy,',
    'you have betrayed everybody and everything.',
    'Can you think of a single degradation that',
    'has not happened to you?\' Winston had stopped',
    'weeping, though the tears were still oozing',
    'out of his eyes. He looked up at O\'Brien.',
    '\'I have not betrayed Julia,\' he said. O\'Brien',
    'looked down at him thoughtfully. \'No,\' he',
    'said; \'no; that is perfectly true. You have',
    'not betrayed Julia.\' The peculiar reverence',
    'for O\'Brien, which nothing seemed able to',
    'destroy, flooded Winston\'s heart again. How',
    'intelligent, he thought, how intelligent!',
    'Never did O\'Brien fail to understand what',
    'was said to him. Anyone else on earth would',
    'have answered promptly that he HAD betrayed',
    'Julia. For what was there that they had not',
    'screwed out of him under the torture? He',
    'had told them everything he knew about her,',
    'her habits, her character, her past life;',
    'he had confessed in the most trivial detail',
    'everything that had happened at their meetings,',
    'all that he had said to her and she to him,',
    'their black-market meals, their adulteries,',
    'their vague plottings against the Party,',
    'everything. And yet, in the sense in which',
    'he intended the word, he had not betrayed',
    'her. He had not stopped loving her; his feelings',
    'towards her had remained the same. O\'Brien',
    'had seen what he meant without the need for',
    'explanation. \'Tell me,\' he said, \'how soon',
    'will they shoot me?\' \'It might be a long',
    'time,\' said O\'Brien. \'You are a difficult',
    'case. But don\'t give up hope. Everyone is',
    'cured sooner or later. In the end we shall',
    'shoot you.\' Chapter 4 He was much better.',
    'He was growing fatter and stronger every',
    'day, if it was proper to speak of days. The',
    'white light and the humming sound were the',
    'same as ever, but the cell was a little more',
    'comfortable than the others he had been in.',
    'There was a pillow and a mattress on the',
    'plank bed, and a stool to sit on. They had',
    'given him a bath, and they allowed him to',
    'wash himself fairly frequently in a tin basin.',
    'They even gave him warm water to wash with.',
    'They had given him new underclothes and a',
    'clean suit of overalls. They had dressed',
    'his varicose ulcer with soothing ointment.',
    'They had pulled out the remnants of his teeth',
    'and given him a new set of dentures. Weeks',
    'or months must have passed. It would have',
    'been possible now to keep count of the passage',
    'of time, if he had felt any interest in doing',
    'so, since he was being fed at what appeared',
    'to be regular intervals. He was getting,',
    'he judged, three meals in the twenty-four',
    'hours; sometimes he wondered dimly whether',
    'he was getting them by night or by day. The',
    'food was surprisingly good, with meat at',
    'every third meal. Once there was even a packet',
    'of cigarettes. He had no matches, but the',
    'never-speaking guard who brought his food',
    'would give him a light. The first time he',
    'tried to smoke it made him sick, but he persevered,',
    'and spun the packet out for a long time,',
    'smoking half a cigarette after each meal.',
    'They had given him a white slate with a stump',
    'of pencil tied to the corner. At first he',
    'made no use of it. Even when he was awake',
    'he was completely torpid. Often he would',
    'lie from one meal to the next almost without',
    'stirring, sometimes asleep, sometimes waking',
    'into vague reveries in which it was too much',
    'trouble to open his eyes. He had long grown',
    'used to sleeping with a strong light on his',
    'face. It seemed to make no difference, except',
    'that one\'s dreams were more coherent. He',
    'dreamed a great deal all through this time,',
    'and they were always happy dreams. He was',
    'in the Golden Country, or he was sitting',
    'among enormous glorious, sunlit ruins, with',
    'his mother, with Julia, with O\'Brien, not',
    'doing anything, merely sitting in the sun,',
    'talking of peaceful things. Such thoughts',
    'as he had when he was awake were mostly about',
    'his dreams. He seemed to have lost the power',
    'of intellectual effort, now that the stimulus',
    'of pain had been removed. He was not bored,',
    'he had no desire for conversation or distraction.',
    'Merely to be alone, not to be beaten or questioned,',
    'to have enough to eat, and to be clean all',
    'over, was completely satisfying. By degrees',
    'he came to spend less time in sleep, but',
    'he still felt no impulse to get off the bed.',
    'All he cared for was to lie quiet and feel',
    'the strength gathering in his body. He would',
    'finger himself here and there, trying to',
    'make sure that it was not an illusion that',
    'his muscles were growing rounder and his',
    'skin tauter. Finally it was established beyond',
    'a doubt that he was growing fatter; his thighs',
    'were now definitely thicker than his knees.',
    'After that, reluctantly at first, he began',
    'exercising himself regularly. In a little',
    'while he could walk three kilometres, measured',
    'by pacing the cell, and his bowed shoulders',
    'were growing straighter. He attempted more',
    'elaborate exercises, and was astonished and',
    'humiliated to find what things he could not',
    'do. He could not move out of a walk, he could',
    'not hold his stool out at arm\'s length, he',
    'could not stand on one leg without falling',
    'over. He squatted down on his heels, and',
    'found that with agonizing pains in thigh',
    'and calf he could just lift himself to a',
    'standing position. He lay flat on his belly',
    'and tried to lift his weight by his hands.',
    'It was hopeless, he could not raise himself',
    'a centimetre. But after a few more days,',
    'a few more mealtimes, even that feat was',
    'accomplished. A time came when he could do',
    'it six times running. He began to grow actually',
    'proud of his body, and to cherish an intermittent',
    'belief that his face also was growing back',
    'to normal. Only when he chanced to put his',
    'hand on his bald scalp did he remember the',
    'seamed, ruined face that had looked back',
    'at him out of the mirror. His mind grew more',
    'active. He sat down on the plank bed, his',
    'back against the wall and the slate on his',
    'knees, and set to work deliberately at the',
    'task of re-educating himself. He had capitulated,',
    'that was agreed. In reality, as he saw now,',
    'he had been ready to capitulate long before',
    'he had taken the decision. From the moment',
    'when he was inside the Ministry of Love,',
    'and yes, even during those minutes when he',
    'and Julia had stood helpless while the iron',
    'voice from the telescreen told them what',
    'to do, he had grasped the frivolity, the',
    'shallowness of his attempt to set himself',
    'up against the power of the Party. He knew',
    'now that for seven years the Thought Police',
    'had watched him like a beetle under a magnifying',
    'glass. There was no physical act, no word',
    'spoken aloud, that they had not noticed,',
    'no train of thought that they had not been',
    'able to infer. Even the speck of whitish',
    'dust on the cover of his diary they had carefully',
    'replaced. They had played sound-tracks to',
    'him, shown him photographs. Some of them',
    'were photographs of Julia and himself. Yes,',
    'even. He could not fight against the Party',
    'any longer. Besides, the Party was in the',
    'right. It must be so; how could the immortal,',
    'collective brain be mistaken? By what external',
    'standard could you check its judgements?',
    'Sanity was statistical. It was merely a question',
    'of learning to think as they thought. Only,',
    ', ! The pencil felt thick and awkward in',
    'his fingers. He began to write down the thoughts',
    'that came into his head. He wrote first in',
    'large clumsy capitals: FREEDOM IS SLAVERY',
    'Then almost without a pause he wrote beneath',
    'it: TWO AND TWO MAKE FIVE But then there',
    'came a sort of check. His mind, as though',
    'shying away from something, seemed unable',
    'to concentrate. He knew that he knew what',
    'came next, but for the moment he could not',
    'recall it. When he did recall it, it was',
    'only by consciously reasoning out what it',
    'must be: it did not come of its own accord.',
    'He wrote: GOD IS POWER He accepted everything.',
    'The past was alterable. The past never had',
    'been altered. Oceania was at war with Eastasia.',
    'Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia.',
    'Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford were guilty',
    'of the crimes they were charged with. He',
    'had never seen the photograph that disproved',
    'their guilt. It had never existed, he had',
    'invented it. He remembered remembering contrary',
    'things, but those were false memories, products',
    'of self-deception. How easy it all was! Only',
    'surrender, and everything else followed.',
    'It was like swimming against a current that',
    'swept you backwards however hard you struggled,',
    'and then suddenly deciding to turn round',
    'and go with the current instead of opposing',
    'it. Nothing had changed except your own attitude:',
    'the predestined thing happened in any case.',
    'He hardly knew why he had ever rebelled.',
    'Everything was easy, except, , ! Anything',
    'could be true. The so-called laws of Nature',
    'were nonsense. The law of gravity was nonsense.',
    '\'If I wished,\' O\'Brien had said, \'I could',
    'float off this floor like a soap bubble.\'',
    'Winston worked it out. \'If he THINKS he floats',
    'off the floor, and if I simultaneously THINK',
    'I see him do it, then the thing happens.\'',
    'Suddenly, like a lump of submerged wreckage',
    'breaking the surface of water, the thought',
    'burst into his mind: \'It doesn\'t really happen.',
    'We imagine it. It is hallucination.\' He pushed',
    'the thought under instantly. The fallacy',
    'was obvious. It presupposed that somewhere',
    'or other, outside oneself, there was a \'real\'',
    'world where \'real\' things happened. But how',
    'could there be such a world? What knowledge',
    'have we of anything, save through our own',
    'minds? All happenings are in the mind. Whatever',
    'happens in all minds, truly happens. He had',
    'no difficulty in disposing of the fallacy,',
    'and he was in no danger of succumbing to',
    'it. He realized, nevertheless, that it ought',
    'never to have occurred to him. The mind should',
    'develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous',
    'thought presented itself. The process should',
    'be automatic, instinctive. CRIMESTOP, they',
    'called it in Newspeak. He set to work to',
    'exercise himself in crimestop. He presented',
    'himself with propositions, \'the Party says',
    'the earth is flat\', \'the party says that',
    'ice is heavier than water\', and trained himself',
    'in not seeing or not understanding the arguments',
    'that contradicted them. It was not easy.',
    'It needed great powers of reasoning and improvisation.',
    'The arithmetical problems raised, for instance,',
    'by such a statement as \'two and two make',
    'five\' were beyond his intellectual grasp.',
    'It needed also a sort of athleticism of mind,',
    'an ability at one moment to make the most',
    'delicate use of logic and at the next to',
    'be unconscious of the crudest logical errors.',
    'Stupidity was as necessary as intelligence,',
    'and as difficult to attain. All the while,',
    'with one part of his mind, he wondered how',
    'soon they would shoot him. \'Everything depends',
    'on yourself,\' O\'Brien had said; but he knew',
    'that there was no conscious act by which',
    'he could bring it nearer. It might be ten',
    'minutes hence, or ten years. They might keep',
    'him for years in solitary confinement, they',
    'might send him to a labour-camp, they might',
    'release him for a while, as they sometimes',
    'did. It was perfectly possible that before',
    'he was shot the whole drama of his arrest',
    'and interrogation would be enacted all over',
    'again. The one certain thing was that death',
    'never came at an expected moment. The tradition,',
    'the unspoken tradition: somehow you knew',
    'it, though you never heard it said, was that',
    'they shot you from behind; always in the',
    'back of the head, without warning, as you',
    'walked down a corridor from cell to cell.',
    'One day, but \'one day\' was not the right',
    'expression; just as probably it was in the',
    'middle of the night: once, he fell into a',
    'strange, blissful reverie. He was walking',
    'down the corridor, waiting for the bullet.',
    'He knew that it was coming in another moment.',
    'Everything was settled, smoothed out, reconciled.',
    'There were no more doubts, no more arguments,',
    'no more pain, no more fear. His body was',
    'healthy and strong. He walked easily, with',
    'a joy of movement and with a feeling of walking',
    'in sunlight. He was not any longer in the',
    'narrow white corridors in the Ministry of',
    'Love, he was in the enormous sunlit passage,',
    'a kilometre wide, down which he had seemed',
    'to walk in the delirium induced by drugs.',
    'He was in the Golden Country, following the',
    'foot-track across the old rabbit-cropped',
    'pasture. He could feel the short springy',
    'turf under his feet and the gentle sunshine',
    'on his face. At the edge of the field were',
    'the elm trees, faintly stirring, and somewhere',
    'beyond that was the stream where the dace',
    'lay in the green pools under the willows.',
    'Suddenly he started up with a shock of horror.',
    'The sweat broke out on his backbone. He had',
    'heard himself cry aloud: \'Julia! Julia! Julia,',
    'my love! Julia!\' For a moment he had had',
    'an overwhelming hallucination of her presence.',
    'She had seemed to be not merely with him,',
    'but inside him. It was as though she had',
    'got into the texture of his skin. In that',
    'moment he had loved her far more than he',
    'had ever done when they were together and',
    'free. Also he knew that somewhere or other',
    'she was still alive and needed his help.',
    'He lay back on the bed and tried to compose',
    'himself. What had he done? How many years',
    'had he added to his servitude by that moment',
    'of weakness? In another moment he would hear',
    'the tramp of boots outside. They could not',
    'let such an outburst go unpunished. They',
    'would know now, if they had not known before,',
    'that he was breaking the agreement he had',
    'made with them. He obeyed the Party, but',
    'he still hated the Party. In the old days',
    'he had hidden a heretical mind beneath an',
    'appearance of conformity. Now he had retreated',
    'a step further: in the mind he had surrendered,',
    'but he had hoped to keep the inner heart',
    'inviolate. He knew that he was in the wrong,',
    'but he preferred to be in the wrong. They',
    'would understand that, O\'Brien would understand',
    'it. It was all confessed in that single foolish',
    'cry. He would have to start all over again.',
    'It might take years. He ran a hand over his',
    'face, trying to familiarize himself with',
    'the new shape. There were deep furrows in',
    'the cheeks, the cheekbones felt sharp, the',
    'nose flattened. Besides, since last seeing',
    'himself in the glass he had been given a',
    'complete new set of teeth. It was not easy',
    'to preserve inscrutability when you did not',
    'know what your face looked like. In any case,',
    'mere control of the features was not enough.',
    'For the first time he perceived that if you',
    'want to keep a secret you must also hide',
    'it from yourself. You must know all the while',
    'that it is there, but until it is needed',
    'you must never let it emerge into your consciousness',
    'in any shape that could be given a name.',
    'From now onwards he must not only think right;',
    'he must feel right, dream right. And all',
    'the while he must keep his hatred locked',
    'up inside him like a ball of matter which',
    'was part of himself and yet unconnected with',
    'the rest of him, a kind of cyst. One day',
    'they would decide to shoot him. You could',
    'not tell when it would happen, but a few',
    'seconds beforehand it should be possible',
    'to guess. It was always from behind, walking',
    'down a corridor. Ten seconds would be enough.',
    'In that time the world inside him could turn',
    'over. And then suddenly, without a word uttered,',
    'without a check in his step, without the',
    'changing of a line in his face, suddenly',
    'the camouflage would be down and bang! would',
    'go the batteries of his hatred. Hatred would',
    'fill him like an enormous roaring flame.',
    'And almost in the same instant bang! would',
    'go the bullet, too late, or too early. They',
    'would have blown his brain to pieces before',
    'they could reclaim it. The heretical thought',
    'would be unpunished, unrepented, out of their',
    'reach for ever. They would have blown a hole',
    'in their own perfection. To die hating them,',
    'that was freedom. He shut his eyes. It was',
    'more difficult than accepting an intellectual',
    'discipline. It was a question of degrading',
    'himself, mutilating himself. He had got to',
    'plunge into the filthiest of filth. What',
    'was the most horrible, sickening thing of',
    'all? He thought of Big Brother. The enormous',
    'face (because of constantly seeing it on',
    'posters he always thought of it as being',
    'a metre wide), with its heavy black moustache',
    'and the eyes that followed you to and fro,',
    'seemed to float into his mind of its own',
    'accord. What were his true feelings towards',
    'Big Brother? There was a heavy tramp of boots',
    'in the passage. The steel door swung open',
    'with a clang. O\'Brien walked into the cell.',
    'Behind him were the waxen-faced officer and',
    'the black-uniformed guards. \'Get up,\' said',
    'O\'Brien. \'Come here.\' Winston stood opposite',
    'him. O\'Brien took Winston\'s shoulders between',
    'his strong hands and looked at him closely.',
    '\'You have had thoughts of deceiving me,\'',
    'he said. \'That was stupid. Stand up straighter.',
    'Look me in the face.\' He paused, and went',
    'on in a gentler tone: \'You are improving.',
    'Intellectually there is very little wrong',
    'with you. It is only emotionally that you',
    'have failed to make progress. Tell me, Winston,',
    'and remember, no lies: you know that I am',
    'always able to detect a lie, tell me, what',
    'are your true feelings towards Big Brother?\'',
    '\'I hate him.\' \'You hate him. Good. Then the',
    'time has come for you to take the last step.',
    'You must love Big Brother. It is not enough',
    'to obey him: you must love him.\' He released',
    'Winston with a little push towards the guards.',
    '\'Room 101,\' he said. Chapter 5 At each stage',
    'of his imprisonment he had known, or seemed',
    'to know, whereabouts he was in the windowless',
    'building. Possibly there were slight differences',
    'in the air pressure. The cells where the',
    'guards had beaten him were below ground level.',
    'The room where he had been interrogated by',
    'O\'Brien was high up near the roof. This place',
    'was many metres underground, as deep down',
    'as it was possible to go. It was bigger than',
    'most of the cells he had been in. But he',
    'hardly noticed his surroundings. All he noticed',
    'was that there were two small tables straight',
    'in front of him, each covered with green',
    'baize. One was only a metre or two from him,',
    'the other was further away, near the door.',
    'He was strapped upright in a chair, so tightly',
    'that he could move nothing, not even his',
    'head. A sort of pad gripped his head from',
    'behind, forcing him to look straight in front',
    'of him. For a moment he was alone, then the',
    'door opened and O\'Brien came in. \'You asked',
    'me once,\' said O\'Brien, \'what was in Room',
    '101. I told you that you knew the answer',
    'already. Everyone knows it. The thing that',
    'is in Room 101 is the worst thing in the',
    'world.\' The door opened again. A guard came',
    'in, carrying something made of wire, a box',
    'or basket of some kind. He set it down on',
    'the further table. Because of the position',
    'in which O\'Brien was standing. Winston could',
    'not see what the thing was. \'The worst thing',
    'in the world,\' said O\'Brien, \'varies from',
    'individual to individual. It may be burial',
    'alive, or death by fire, or by drowning,',
    'or by impalement, or fifty other deaths.',
    'There are cases where it is some quite trivial',
    'thing, not even fatal.\' He had moved a little',
    'to one side, so that Winston had a better',
    'view of the thing on the table. It was an',
    'oblong wire cage with a handle on top for',
    'carrying it by. Fixed to the front of it',
    'was something that looked like a fencing',
    'mask, with the concave side outwards. Although',
    'it was three or four metres away from him,',
    'he could see that the cage was divided lengthways',
    'into two compartments, and that there was',
    'some kind of creature in each. They were',
    'rats. \'In your case,\' said O\'Brien, \'the',
    'worst thing in the world happens to be rats.\'',
    'A sort of premonitory tremor, a fear of he',
    'was not certain what, had passed through',
    'Winston as soon as he caught his first glimpse',
    'of the cage. But at this moment the meaning',
    'of the mask-like attachment in front of it',
    'suddenly sank into him. His bowels seemed',
    'to turn to water. \'You can\'t do that!\' he',
    'cried out in a high cracked voice. \'You couldn\'t,',
    'you couldn\'t! It\'s impossible.\' \'Do you remember,\'',
    'said O\'Brien, \'the moment of panic that used',
    'to occur in your dreams? There was a wall',
    'of blackness in front of you, and a roaring',
    'sound in your ears. There was something terrible',
    'on the other side of the wall. You knew that',
    'you knew what it was, but you dared not drag',
    'it into the open. It was the rats that were',
    'on the other side of the wall.\' \'O\'Brien!\'',
    'said Winston, making an effort to control',
    'his voice. \'You know this is not necessary.',
    'What is it that you want me to do?\' O\'Brien',
    'made no direct answer. When he spoke it was',
    'in the schoolmasterish manner that he sometimes',
    'affected. He looked thoughtfully into the',
    'distance, as though he were addressing an',
    'audience somewhere behind Winston\'s back.',
    '\'By itself,\' he said, \'pain is not always',
    'enough. There are occasions when a human',
    'being will stand out against pain, even to',
    'the point of death. But for everyone there',
    'is something unendurable, something that',
    'cannot be contemplated. Courage and cowardice',
    'are not involved. If you are falling from',
    'a height it is not cowardly to clutch at',
    'a rope. If you have come up from deep water',
    'it is not cowardly to fill your lungs with',
    'air. It is merely an instinct which cannot',
    'be destroyed. It is the same with the rats.',
    'For you, they are unendurable. They are a',
    'form of pressure that you cannot withstand,',
    'even if you wished to. You will do what is',
    'required of you.\' \'But what is it, what is',
    'it? How can I do it if I don\'t know what',
    'it is?\' O\'Brien picked up the cage and brought',
    'it across to the nearer table. He set it',
    'down carefully on the baize cloth. Winston',
    'could hear the blood singing in his ears.',
    'He had the feeling of sitting in utter loneliness.',
    'He was in the middle of a great empty plain,',
    'a flat desert drenched with sunlight, across',
    'which all sounds came to him out of immense',
    'distances. Yet the cage with the rats was',
    'not two metres away from him. They were enormous',
    'rats. They were at the age when a rat\'s muzzle',
    'grows blunt and fierce and his fur brown',
    'instead of grey. \'The rat,\' said O\'Brien,',
    'still addressing his invisible audience,',
    '\'although a rodent, is carnivorous. You are',
    'aware of that. You will have heard of the',
    'things that happen in the poor quarters of',
    'this town. In some streets a woman dare not',
    'leave her baby alone in the house, even for',
    'five minutes. The rats are certain to attack',
    'it. Within quite a small time they will strip',
    'it to the bones. They also attack sick or',
    'dying people. They show astonishing intelligence',
    'in knowing when a human being is helpless.\'',
    'There was an outburst of squeals from the',
    'cage. It seemed to reach Winston from far',
    'away. The rats were fighting; they were trying',
    'to get at each other through the partition.',
    'He heard also a deep groan of despair. That,',
    'too, seemed to come from outside himself.',
    'O\'Brien picked up the cage, and, as he did',
    'so, pressed something in it. There was a',
    'sharp click. Winston made a frantic effort',
    'to tear himself loose from the chair. It',
    'was hopeless; every part of him, even his',
    'head, was held immovably. O\'Brien moved the',
    'cage nearer. It was less than a metre from',
    'Winston\'s face. \'I have pressed the first',
    'lever,\' said O\'Brien. \'You understand the',
    'construction of this cage. The mask will',
    'fit over your head, leaving no exit. When',
    'I press this other lever, the door of the',
    'cage will slide up. These starving brutes',
    'will shoot out of it like bullets. Have you',
    'ever seen a rat leap through the air? They',
    'will leap on to your face and bore straight',
    'into it. Sometimes they attack the eyes first.',
    'Sometimes they burrow through the cheeks',
    'and devour the tongue.\' The cage was nearer;',
    'it was closing in. Winston heard a succession',
    'of shrill cries which appeared to be occurring',
    'in the air above his head. But he fought',
    'furiously against his panic. To think, to',
    'think, even with a split second left, to',
    'think was the only hope. Suddenly the foul',
    'musty odour of the brutes struck his nostrils.',
    'There was a violent convulsion of nausea',
    'inside him, and he almost lost consciousness.',
    'Everything had gone black. For an instant',
    'he was insane, a screaming animal. Yet he',
    'came out of the blackness clutching an idea.',
    'There was one and only one way to save himself.',
    'He must interpose another human being, the',
    'BODY of another human being, between himself',
    'and the rats. The circle of the mask was',
    'large enough now to shut out the vision of',
    'anything else. The wire door was a couple',
    'of hand-spans from his face. The rats knew',
    'what was coming now. One of them was leaping',
    'up and down, the other, an old scaly grandfather',
    'of the sewers, stood up, with his pink hands',
    'against the bars, and fiercely sniffed the',
    'air. Winston could see the whiskers and the',
    'yellow teeth. Again the black panic took',
    'hold of him. He was blind, helpless, mindless.',
    '\'It was a common punishment in Imperial China,\'',
    'said O\'Brien as didactically as ever. The',
    'mask was closing on his face. The wire brushed',
    'his cheek. And then, no, it was not relief,',
    'only hope, a tiny fragment of hope. Too late,',
    'perhaps too late. But he had suddenly understood',
    'that in the whole world there was just ONE',
    'person to whom he could transfer his punishment,',
    'ONE body that he could thrust between himself',
    'and the rats. And he was shouting frantically,',
    'over and over. \'Do it to Julia! Do it to',
    'Julia! Not me! Julia! I don\'t care what you',
    'do to her. Tear her face off, strip her to',
    'the bones. Not me! Julia! Not me!\' He was',
    'falling backwards, into enormous depths,',
    'away from the rats. He was still strapped',
    'in the chair, but he had fallen through the',
    'floor, through the walls of the building,',
    'through the earth, through the oceans, through',
    'the atmosphere, into outer space, into the',
    'gulfs between the stars, always away, away,',
    'away from the rats. He was light years distant,',
    'but O\'Brien was still standing at his side.',
    'There was still the cold touch of wire against',
    'his cheek. But through the darkness that',
    'enveloped him he heard another metallic click,',
    'and knew that the cage door had clicked shut',
    'and not open. Chapter 6 The Chestnut Tree',
    'was almost empty. A ray of sunlight slanting',
    'through a window fell on dusty table-tops.',
    'It was the lonely hour of fifteen. A tinny',
    'music trickled from the telescreens. Winston',
    'sat in his usual corner, gazing into an empty',
    'glass. Now and again he glanced up at a vast',
    'face which eyed him from the opposite wall.',
    'BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption',
    'said. Unbidden, a waiter came and filled',
    'his glass up with Victory Gin, shaking into',
    'it a few drops from another bottle with a',
    'quill through the cork. It was saccharine',
    'flavoured with cloves, the speciality of',
    'the cafe. Winston was listening to the telescreen.',
    'At present only music was coming out of it,',
    'but there was a possibility that at any moment',
    'there might be a special bulletin from the',
    'Ministry of Peace. The news from the African',
    'front was disquieting in the extreme. On',
    'and off he had been worrying about it all',
    'day. A Eurasian army (Oceania was at war',
    'with Eurasia: Oceania had always been at',
    'war with Eurasia) was moving southward at',
    'terrifying speed. The mid-day bulletin had',
    'not mentioned any definite area, but it was',
    'probable that already the mouth of the Congo',
    'was a battlefield. Brazzaville and Leopoldville',
    'were in danger. One did not have to look',
    'at the map to see what it meant. It was not',
    'merely a question of losing Central Africa:',
    'for the first time in the whole war, the',
    'territory of Oceania itself was menaced.',
    'A violent emotion, not fear exactly but a',
    'sort of undifferentiated excitement, flared',
    'up in him, then faded again. He stopped thinking',
    'about the war. In these days he could never',
    'fix his mind on any one subject for more',
    'than a few moments at a time. He picked up',
    'his glass and drained it at a gulp. As always,',
    'the gin made him shudder and even retch slightly.',
    'The stuff was horrible. The cloves and saccharine,',
    'themselves disgusting enough in their sickly',
    'way, could not disguise the flat oily smell;',
    'and what was worst of all was that the smell',
    'of gin, which dwelt with him night and day,',
    'was inextricably mixed up in his mind with',
    'the smell of those, ,  He never named them,',
    'even in his thoughts, and so far as it was',
    'possible he never visualized them. They were',
    'something that he was half-aware of, hovering',
    'close to his face, a smell that clung to',
    'his nostrils. As the gin rose in him he belched',
    'through purple lips. He had grown fatter',
    'since they released him, and had regained',
    'his old colour, indeed, more than regained',
    'it. His features had thickened, the skin',
    'on nose and cheekbones was coarsely red,',
    'even the bald scalp was too deep a pink.',
    'A waiter, again unbidden, brought the chessboard',
    'and the current issue of \'The Times\', with',
    'the page turned down at the chess problem.',
    'Then, seeing that Winston\'s glass was empty,',
    'he brought the gin bottle and filled it.',
    'There was no need to give orders. They knew',
    'his habits. The chessboard was always waiting',
    'for him, his corner table was always reserved;',
    'even when the place was full he had it to',
    'himself, since nobody cared to be seen sitting',
    'too close to him. He never even bothered',
    'to count his drinks. At irregular intervals',
    'they presented him with a dirty slip of paper',
    'which they said was the bill, but he had',
    'the impression that they always undercharged',
    'him. It would have made no difference if',
    'it had been the other way about. He had always',
    'plenty of money nowadays. He even had a job,',
    'a sinecure, more highly-paid than his old',
    'job had been. The music from the telescreen',
    'stopped and a voice took over. Winston raised',
    'his head to listen. No bulletins from the',
    'front, however. It was merely a brief announcement',
    'from the Ministry of Plenty. In the preceding',
    'quarter, it appeared, the Tenth Three-Year',
    'Plan\'s quota for bootlaces had been overfulfilled',
    'by 98 per cent. He examined the chess problem',
    'and set out the pieces. It was a tricky ending,',
    'involving a couple of knights. \'White to',
    'play and mate in two moves.\' Winston looked',
    'up at the portrait of Big Brother. White',
    'always mates, he thought with a sort of cloudy',
    'mysticism. Always, without exception, it',
    'is so arranged. In no chess problem since',
    'the beginning of the world has black ever',
    'won. Did it not symbolize the eternal, unvarying',
    'triumph of Good over Evil? The huge face',
    'gazed back at him, full of calm power. White',
    'always mates. The voice from the telescreen',
    'paused and added in a different and much',
    'graver tone: \'You are warned to stand by',
    'for an important announcement at fifteen-thirty.',
    'Fifteen-thirty! This is news of the highest',
    'importance. Take care not to miss it. Fifteen-thirty!\'',
    'The tinkling music struck up again. Winston\'s',
    'heart stirred. That was the bulletin from',
    'the front; instinct told him that it was',
    'bad news that was coming. All day, with little',
    'spurts of excitement, the thought of a smashing',
    'defeat in Africa had been in and out of his',
    'mind. He seemed actually to see the Eurasian',
    'army swarming across the never-broken frontier',
    'and pouring down into the tip of Africa like',
    'a column of ants. Why had it not been possible',
    'to outflank them in some way? The outline',
    'of the West African coast stood out vividly',
    'in his mind. He picked up the white knight',
    'and moved it across the board. THERE was',
    'the proper spot. Even while he saw the black',
    'horde racing southward he saw another force,',
    'mysteriously assembled, suddenly planted',
    'in their rear, cutting their communications',
    'by land and sea. He felt that by willing',
    'it he was bringing that other force into',
    'existence. But it was necessary to act quickly.',
    'If they could get control of the whole of',
    'Africa, if they had airfields and submarine',
    'bases at the Cape, it would cut Oceania in',
    'two. It might mean anything: defeat, breakdown,',
    'the redivision of the world, the destruction',
    'of the Party! He drew a deep breath. An extraordinary',
    'medley of feeling, but it was not a medley,',
    'exactly; rather it was successive layers',
    'of feeling, in which one could not say which',
    'layer was undermost, struggled inside him.',
    'The spasm passed. He put the white knight',
    'back in its place, but for the moment he',
    'could not settle down to serious study of',
    'the chess problem. His thoughts wandered',
    'again. Almost unconsciously he traced with',
    'his finger in the dust on the table: 2+2=5',
    '\'They can\'t get inside you,\' she had said.',
    'But they could get inside you. \'What happens',
    'to you here is FOR EVER,\' O\'Brien had said.',
    'That was a true word. There were things,',
    'your own acts, from which you could never',
    'recover. Something was killed in your breast:',
    'burnt out, cauterized out. He had seen her;',
    'he had even spoken to her. There was no danger',
    'in it. He knew as though instinctively that',
    'they now took almost no interest in his doings.',
    'He could have arranged to meet her a second',
    'time if either of them had wanted to. Actually',
    'it was by chance that they had met. It was',
    'in the Park, on a vile, biting day in March,',
    'when the earth was like iron and all the',
    'grass seemed dead and there was not a bud',
    'anywhere except a few crocuses which had',
    'pushed themselves up to be dismembered by',
    'the wind. He was hurrying along with frozen',
    'hands and watering eyes when he saw her not',
    'ten metres away from him. It struck him at',
    'once that she had changed in some ill-defined',
    'way. They almost passed one another without',
    'a sign, then he turned and followed her,',
    'not very eagerly. He knew that there was',
    'no danger, nobody would take any interest',
    'in him. She did not speak. She walked obliquely',
    'away across the grass as though trying to',
    'get rid of him, then seemed to resign herself',
    'to having him at her side. Presently they',
    'were in among a clump of ragged leafless',
    'shrubs, useless either for concealment or',
    'as protection from the wind. They halted.',
    'It was vilely cold. The wind whistled through',
    'the twigs and fretted the occasional, dirty-looking',
    'crocuses. He put his arm round her waist.',
    'There was no telescreen, but there must be',
    'hidden microphones: besides, they could be',
    'seen. It did not matter, nothing mattered.',
    'They could have lain down on the ground and',
    'done THAT if they had wanted to. His flesh',
    'froze with horror at the thought of it. She',
    'made no response whatever to the clasp of',
    'his arm; she did not even try to disengage',
    'herself. He knew now what had changed in',
    'her. Her face was sallower, and there was',
    'a long scar, partly hidden by the hair, across',
    'her forehead and temple; but that was not',
    'the change. It was that her waist had grown',
    'thicker, and, in a surprising way, had stiffened.',
    'He remembered how once, after the explosion',
    'of a rocket bomb, he had helped to drag a',
    'corpse out of some ruins, and had been astonished',
    'not only by the incredible weight of the',
    'thing, but by its rigidity and awkwardness',
    'to handle, which made it seem more like stone',
    'than flesh. Her body felt like that. It occurred',
    'to him that the texture of her skin would',
    'be quite different from what it had once',
    'been. He did not attempt to kiss her, nor',
    'did they speak. As they walked back across',
    'the grass, she looked directly at him for',
    'the first time. It was only a momentary glance,',
    'full of contempt and dislike. He wondered',
    'whether it was a dislike that came purely',
    'out of the past or whether it was inspired',
    'also by his bloated face and the water that',
    'the wind kept squeezing from his eyes. They',
    'sat down on two iron chairs, side by side',
    'but not too close together. He saw that she',
    'was about to speak. She moved her clumsy',
    'shoe a few centimetres and deliberately crushed',
    'a twig. Her feet seemed to have grown broader,',
    'he noticed. \'I betrayed you,\' she said baldly.',
    '\'I betrayed you,\' he said. She gave him another',
    'quick look of dislike. \'Sometimes,\' she said,',
    '\'they threaten you with something something',
    'you can\'t stand up to, can\'t even think about.',
    'And then you say, "Don\'t do it to me, do',
    'it to somebody else, do it to so-and-so."',
    'And perhaps you might pretend, afterwards,',
    'that it was only a trick and that you just',
    'said it to make them stop and didn\'t really',
    'mean it. But that isn\'t true. At the time',
    'when it happens you do mean it. You think',
    'there\'s no other way of saving yourself,',
    'and you\'re quite ready to save yourself that',
    'way. You WANT it to happen to the other person.',
    'You don\'t give a damn what they suffer. All',
    'you care about is yourself.\' \'All you care',
    'about is yourself,\' he echoed. \'And after',
    'that, you don\'t feel the same towards the',
    'other person any longer.\' \'No,\' he said,',
    '\'you don\'t feel the same.\' There did not',
    'seem to be anything more to say. The wind',
    'plastered their thin overalls against their',
    'bodies. Almost at once it became embarrassing',
    'to sit there in silence: besides, it was',
    'too cold to keep still. She said something',
    'about catching her Tube and stood up to go.',
    '\'We must meet again,\' he said. \'Yes,\' she',
    'said, \'we must meet again.\' He followed irresolutely',
    'for a little distance, half a pace behind',
    'her. They did not speak again. She did not',
    'actually try to shake him off, but walked',
    'at just such a speed as to prevent his keeping',
    'abreast of her. He had made up his mind that',
    'he would accompany her as far as the Tube',
    'station, but suddenly this process of trailing',
    'along in the cold seemed pointless and unbearable.',
    'He was overwhelmed by a desire not so much',
    'to get away from Julia as to get back to',
    'the Chestnut Tree Cafe, which had never seemed',
    'so attractive as at this moment. He had a',
    'nostalgic vision of his corner table, with',
    'the newspaper and the chessboard and the',
    'ever-flowing gin. Above all, it would be',
    'warm in there. The next moment, not altogether',
    'by accident, he allowed himself to become',
    'separated from her by a small knot of people.',
    'He made a half-hearted attempt to catch up,',
    'then slowed down, turned, and made off in',
    'the opposite direction. When he had gone',
    'fifty metres he looked back. The street was',
    'not crowded, but already he could not distinguish',
    'her. Any one of a dozen hurrying figures',
    'might have been hers. Perhaps her thickened,',
    'stiffened body was no longer recognizable',
    'from behind. \'At the time when it happens,\'',
    'she had said, \'you do mean it.\' He had meant',
    'it. He had not merely said it, he had wished',
    'it. He had wished that she and not he should',
    'be delivered over to the, ,  Something changed',
    'in the music that trickled from the telescreen.',
    'A cracked and jeering note, a yellow note,',
    'came into it. And then, perhaps it was not',
    'happening, perhaps it was only a memory taking',
    'on the semblance of sound, a voice was singing:',
    '\'Under the spreading chestnut tree I sold',
    'you and you sold me, , \' The tears welled',
    'up in his eyes. A passing waiter noticed',
    'that his glass was empty and came back with',
    'the gin bottle. He took up his glass and',
    'sniffed at it. The stuff grew not less but',
    'more horrible with every mouthful he drank.',
    'But it had become the element he swam in.',
    'It was his life, his death, and his resurrection.',
    'It was gin that sank him into stupor every',
    'night, and gin that revived him every morning.',
    'When he woke, seldom before eleven hundred,',
    'with gummed-up eyelids and fiery mouth and',
    'a back that seemed to be broken, it would',
    'have been impossible even to rise from the',
    'horizontal if it had not been for the bottle',
    'and teacup placed beside the bed overnight.',
    'Through the midday hours he sat with glazed',
    'face, the bottle handy, listening to the',
    'telescreen. From fifteen to closing-time',
    'he was a fixture in the Chestnut Tree. No',
    'one cared what he did any longer, no whistle',
    'woke him, no telescreen admonished him. Occasionally,',
    'perhaps twice a week, he went to a dusty,',
    'forgotten-looking office in the Ministry',
    'of Truth and did a little work, or what was',
    'called work. He had been appointed to a sub-committee',
    'of a sub-committee which had sprouted from',
    'one of the innumerable committees dealing',
    'with minor difficulties that arose in the',
    'compilation of the Eleventh Edition of the',
    'Newspeak Dictionary. They were engaged in',
    'producing something called an Interim Report,',
    'but what it was that they were reporting',
    'on he had never definitely found out. It',
    'was something to do with the question of',
    'whether commas should be placed inside brackets,',
    'or outside. There were four others on the',
    'committee, all of them persons similar to',
    'himself. There were days when they assembled',
    'and then promptly dispersed again, frankly',
    'admitting to one another that there was not',
    'really anything to be done. But there were',
    'other days when they settled down to their',
    'work almost eagerly, making a tremendous',
    'show of entering up their minutes and drafting',
    'long memoranda which were never finished,',
    'when the argument as to what they were supposedly',
    'arguing about grew extraordinarily involved',
    'and abstruse, with subtle haggling over definitions,',
    'enormous digressions, quarrels, threats,',
    'even, to appeal to higher authority. And',
    'then suddenly the life would go out of them',
    'and they would sit round the table looking',
    'at one another with extinct eyes, like ghosts',
    'fading at cock-crow. The telescreen was silent',
    'for a moment. Winston raised his head again.',
    'The bulletin! But no, they were merely changing',
    'the music. He had the map of Africa behind',
    'his eyelids. The movement of the armies was',
    'a diagram: a black arrow tearing vertically',
    'southward, and a white arrow horizontally',
    'eastward, across the tail of the first. As',
    'though for reassurance he looked up at the',
    'imperturbable face in the portrait. Was it',
    'conceivable that the second arrow did not',
    'even exist? His interest flagged again. He',
    'drank another mouthful of gin, picked up',
    'the white knight and made a tentative move.',
    'Check. But it was evidently not the right',
    'move, because, ,  Uncalled, a memory floated',
    'into his mind. He saw a candle-lit room with',
    'a vast white-counterpaned bed, and himself,',
    'a boy of nine or ten, sitting on the floor,',
    'shaking a dice-box, and laughing excitedly.',
    'His mother was sitting opposite him and also',
    'laughing. It must have been about a month',
    'before she disappeared. It was a moment of',
    'reconciliation, when the nagging hunger in',
    'his belly was forgotten and his earlier affection',
    'for her had temporarily revived. He remembered',
    'the day well, a pelting, drenching day when',
    'the water streamed down the window-pane and',
    'the light indoors was too dull to read by.',
    'The boredom of the two children in the dark,',
    'cramped bedroom became unbearable. Winston',
    'whined and grizzled, made futile demands',
    'for food, fretted about the room pulling',
    'everything out of place and kicking the wainscoting',
    'until the neighbours banged on the wall,',
    'while the younger child wailed intermittently.',
    'In the end his mother said, \'Now be good,',
    'and I\'ll buy you a toy. A lovely toy, you\'ll',
    'love it\'; and then she had gone out in the',
    'rain, to a little general shop which was',
    'still sporadically open nearby, and came',
    'back with a cardboard box containing an outfit',
    'of Snakes and Ladders. He could still remember',
    'the smell of the damp cardboard. It was a',
    'miserable outfit. The board was cracked and',
    'the tiny wooden dice were so ill-cut that',
    'they would hardly lie on their sides. Winston',
    'looked at the thing sulkily and without interest.',
    'But then his mother lit a piece of candle',
    'and they sat down on the floor to play. Soon',
    'he was wildly excited and shouting with laughter',
    'as the tiddly-winks climbed hopefully up',
    'the ladders and then came slithering down',
    'the snakes again, almost to the starting-point.',
    'They played eight games, winning four each.',
    'His tiny sister, too young to understand',
    'what the game was about, had sat propped',
    'up against a bolster, laughing because the',
    'others were laughing. For a whole afternoon',
    'they had all been happy together, as in his',
    'earlier childhood. He pushed the picture',
    'out of his mind. It was a false memory. He',
    'was troubled by false memories occasionally.',
    'They did not matter so long as one knew them',
    'for what they were. Some things had happened,',
    'others had not happened. He turned back to',
    'the chessboard and picked up the white knight',
    'again. Almost in the same instant it dropped',
    'on to the board with a clatter. He had started',
    'as though a pin had run into him. A shrill',
    'trumpet-call had pierced the air. It was',
    'the bulletin! Victory! It always meant victory',
    'when a trumpet-call preceded the news. A',
    'sort of electric drill ran through the cafe.',
    'Even the waiters had started and pricked',
    'up their ears. The trumpet-call had let loose',
    'an enormous volume of noise. Already an excited',
    'voice was gabbling from the telescreen, but',
    'even as it started it was almost drowned',
    'by a roar of cheering from outside. The news',
    'had run round the streets like magic. He',
    'could hear just enough of what was issuing',
    'from the telescreen to realize that it had',
    'all happened, as he had foreseen; a vast',
    'seaborne armada had secretly assembled a',
    'sudden blow in the enemy\'s rear, the white',
    'arrow tearing across the tail of the black.',
    'Fragments of triumphant phrases pushed themselves',
    'through the din: \'Vast strategic manoeuvre,',
    'perfect co-ordination, utter rout, half a',
    'million prisoners, complete demoralization,',
    'control of the whole of Africa, bring the',
    'war within measurable distance of its end,',
    'victory, greatest victory in human history,',
    'victory, victory, victory!\' Under the table',
    'Winston\'s feet made convulsive movements.',
    'He had not stirred from his seat, but in',
    'his mind he was running, swiftly running,',
    'he was with the crowds outside, cheering',
    'himself deaf. He looked up again at the portrait',
    'of Big Brother. The colossus that bestrode',
    'the world! The rock against which the hordes',
    'of Asia dashed themselves in vain! He thought',
    'how ten minutes ago, yes, only ten minutes,',
    'there had still been equivocation in his',
    'heart as he wondered whether the news from',
    'the front would be of victory or defeat.',
    'Ah, it was more than a Eurasian army that',
    'had perished! Much had changed in him since',
    'that first day in the Ministry of Love, but',
    'the final, indispensable, healing change',
    'had never happened, until this moment. The',
    'voice from the telescreen was still pouring',
    'forth its tale of prisoners and booty and',
    'slaughter, but the shouting outside had died',
    'down a little. The waiters were turning back',
    'to their work. One of them approached with',
    'the gin bottle. Winston, sitting in a blissful',
    'dream, paid no attention as his glass was',
    'filled up. He was not running or cheering',
    'any longer. He was back in the Ministry of',
    'Love, with everything forgiven, his soul',
    'white as snow. He was in the public dock,',
    'confessing everything, implicating everybody.',
    'He was walking down the white-tiled corridor,',
    'with the feeling of walking in sunlight,',
    'and an armed guard at his back. The long-hoped-for',
    'bullet was entering his brain. He gazed up',
    'at the enormous face. Forty years it had',
    'taken him to learn what kind of smile was',
    'hidden beneath the dark moustache. O cruel,',
    'needless misunderstanding! O stubborn, self-willed',
    'exile from the loving breast! Two gin-scented',
    'tears trickled down the sides of his nose.',
    'But it was all right, everything was all',
    'right, the struggle was finished. He had',
    'won the victory over himself. He loved Big',
    'Brother. THE END APPENDIX. The Principles',
    'of Newspeak Newspeak was the official language',
    'of Oceania and had been devised to meet the',
    'ideological needs of Ingsoc, or English Socialism.',
    'In the year 1984 there was not as yet anyone',
    'who used Newspeak as his sole means of communication,',
    'either in speech or writing. The leading',
    'articles in \'The Times\' were written in it,',
    'but this was a TOUR DE FORCE which could',
    'only be carried out by a specialist. It was',
    'expected that Newspeak would have finally',
    'superseded Oldspeak (or Standard English,',
    'as we should call it) by about the year 2050.',
    'Meanwhile it gained ground steadily, all',
    'Party members tending to use Newspeak words',
    'and grammatical constructions more and more',
    'in their everyday speech. The version in',
    'use in 1984, and embodied in the Ninth and',
    'Tenth Editions of the Newspeak Dictionary,',
    'was a provisional one, and contained many',
    'superfluous words and archaic formations',
    'which were due to be suppressed later. It',
    'is with the final, perfected version, as',
    'embodied in the Eleventh Edition of the Dictionary,',
    'that we are concerned here. The purpose of',
    'Newspeak was not only to provide a medium',
    'of expression for the world-view and mental',
    'habits proper to the devotees of Ingsoc,',
    'but to make all other modes of thought impossible.',
    'It was intended that when Newspeak had been',
    'adopted once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten,',
    'a heretical thought, that is, a thought diverging',
    'from the principles of Ingsoc, should be',
    'literally unthinkable, at least so far as',
    'thought is dependent on words. Its vocabulary',
    'was so constructed as to give exact and often',
    'very subtle expression to every meaning that',
    'a Party member could properly wish to express,',
    'while excluding all other meanings and also',
    'the possibility of arriving at them by indirect',
    'methods. This was done partly by the invention',
    'of new words, but chiefly by eliminating',
    'undesirable words and by stripping such words',
    'as remained of unorthodox meanings, and so',
    'far as possible of all secondary meanings',
    'whatever. To give a single example. The word',
    'FREE still existed in Newspeak, but it could',
    'only be used in such statements as \'This',
    'dog is free from lice\' or \'This field is',
    'free from weeds\'. It could not be used in',
    'its old sense of \'politically free\' or \'intellectually',
    'free\' since political and intellectual freedom',
    'no longer existed even as concepts, and were',
    'therefore of necessity nameless. Quite apart',
    'from the suppression of definitely heretical',
    'words, reduction of vocabulary was regarded',
    'as an end in itself, and no word that could',
    'be dispensed with was allowed to survive.',
    'Newspeak was designed not to extend but to',
    'DIMINISH the range of thought, and this purpose',
    'was indirectly assisted by cutting the choice',
    'of words down to a minimum. Newspeak was',
    'founded on the English language as we now',
    'know it, though many Newspeak sentences,',
    'even when not containing newly-created words,',
    'would be barely intelligible to an English-speaker',
    'of our own day. Newspeak words were divided',
    'into three distinct classes, known as the',
    'A vocabulary, the B vocabulary (also called',
    'compound words), and the C vocabulary. It',
    'will be simpler to discuss each class separately,',
    'but the grammatical peculiarities of the',
    'language can be dealt with in the section',
    'devoted to the A vocabulary, since the same',
    'rules held good for all three categories.',
    'THE A VOCABULARY. The A vocabulary consisted',
    'of the words needed for the business of everyday',
    'life, for such things as eating, drinking,',
    'working, putting on one\'s clothes, going',
    'up and down stairs, riding in vehicles, gardening,',
    'cooking, and the like. It was composed almost',
    'entirely of words that we already possess',
    'words like HIT, RUN, DOG, TREE, SUGAR, HOUSE,',
    'FIELD, but in comparison with the present-day',
    'English vocabulary their number was extremely',
    'small, while their meanings were far more',
    'rigidly defined. All ambiguities and shades',
    'of meaning had been purged out of them. So',
    'far as it could be achieved, a Newspeak word',
    'of this class was simply a staccato sound',
    'expressing ONE clearly understood concept.',
    'It would have been quite impossible to use',
    'the A vocabulary for literary purposes or',
    'for political or philosophical discussion.',
    'It was intended only to express simple, purposive',
    'thoughts, usually involving concrete objects',
    'or physical actions. The grammar of Newspeak',
    'had two outstanding peculiarities. The first',
    'of these was an almost complete interchangeability',
    'between different parts of speech. Any word',
    'in the language (in principle this applied',
    'even to very abstract words such as IF or',
    'WHEN) could be used either as verb, noun,',
    'adjective, or adverb. Between the verb and',
    'the noun form, when they were of the same',
    'root, there was never any variation, this',
    'rule of itself involving the destruction',
    'of many archaic forms. The word THOUGHT,',
    'for example, did not exist in Newspeak. Its',
    'place was taken by THINK, which did duty',
    'for both noun and verb. No etymological principle',
    'was followed here: in some cases it was the',
    'original noun that was chosen for retention,',
    'in other cases the verb. Even where a noun',
    'and verb of kindred meaning were not etymologically',
    'connected, one or other of them was frequently',
    'suppressed. There was, for example, no such',
    'word as CUT, its meaning being sufficiently',
    'covered by the noun-verb KNIFE. Adjectives',
    'were formed by adding the suffix -FUL to',
    'the noun-verb, and adverbs by adding -WISE.',
    'Thus for example, SPEEDFUL meant \'rapid\'',
    'and SPEEDWISE meant \'quickly\'. Certain of',
    'our present-day adjectives, such as GOOD,',
    'STRONG, BIG, BLACK, SOFT, were retained,',
    'but their total number was very small. There',
    'was little need for them, since almost any',
    'adjectival meaning could be arrived at by',
    'adding -FUL to a noun-verb. None of the now-existing',
    'adverbs was retained, except for a very few',
    'already ending in -WISE: the -WISE termination',
    'was invariable. The word WELL, for example,',
    'was replaced by GOODWISE. In addition, any',
    'word, this again applied in principle to',
    'every word in the language, could be negatived',
    'by adding the affix UN-, or could be strengthened',
    'by the affix PLUS-, or, for still greater',
    'emphasis, DOUBLEPLUS-. Thus, for example,',
    'UNCOLD meant \'warm\', while PLUSCOLD and DOUBLEPLUSCOLD',
    'meant, respectively, \'very cold\' and \'superlatively',
    'cold\'. It was also possible, as in present-day',
    'English, to modify the meaning of almost',
    'any word by prepositional affixes such as',
    'ANTE-, POST-, UP-, DOWN-, etc. By such methods',
    'it was found possible to bring about an enormous',
    'diminution of vocabulary. Given, for instance,',
    'the word GOOD, there was no need for such',
    'a word as BAD, since the required meaning',
    'was equally well, indeed, better, expressed',
    'by UNGOOD. All that was necessary, in any',
    'case where two words formed a natural pair',
    'of opposites, was to decide which of them',
    'to suppress. DARK, for example, could be',
    'replaced by UNLIGHT, or LIGHT by UNDARK,',
    'according to preference. The second distinguishing',
    'mark of Newspeak grammar was its regularity.',
    'Subject to a few exceptions which are mentioned',
    'below all inflexions followed the same rules.',
    'Thus, in all verbs the preterite and the',
    'past participle were the same and ended in',
    '-ED. The preterite of STEAL was STEALED,',
    'the preterite of THINK was THINKED, and so',
    'on throughout the language, all such forms',
    'as SWAM, GAVE, BROUGHT, SPOKE, TAKEN, etc.,',
    'being abolished. All plurals were made by',
    'adding -S or -ES as the case might be. The',
    'plurals OF MAN, OX, LIFE, were MANS, OXES,',
    'LIFES. Comparison of adjectives was invariably',
    'made by adding -ER, -EST (GOOD, GOODER, GOODEST),',
    'irregular forms and the MORE, MOST formation',
    'being suppressed. The only classes of words',
    'that were still allowed to inflect irregularly',
    'were the pronouns, the relatives, the demonstrative',
    'adjectives, and the auxiliary verbs. All',
    'of these followed their ancient usage, except',
    'that WHOM had been scrapped as unnecessary,',
    'and the SHALL, SHOULD tenses had been dropped,',
    'all their uses being covered by WILL and',
    'WOULD. There were also certain irregularities',
    'in word-formation arising out of the need',
    'for rapid and easy speech. A word which was',
    'difficult to utter, or was liable to be incorrectly',
    'heard, was held to be ipso facto a bad word;',
    'occasionally therefore, for the sake of euphony,',
    'extra letters were inserted into a word or',
    'an archaic formation was retained. But this',
    'need made itself felt chiefly in connexion',
    'with the B vocabulary. WHY so great an importance',
    'was attached to ease of pronunciation will',
    'be made clear later in this essay. THE B',
    'VOCABULARY. The B vocabulary consisted of',
    'words which had been deliberately constructed',
    'for political purposes: words, that is to',
    'say, which not only had in every case a political',
    'implication, but were intended to impose',
    'a desirable mental attitude upon the person',
    'using them. Without a full understanding',
    'of the principles of Ingsoc it was difficult',
    'to use these words correctly. In some cases',
    'they could be translated into Oldspeak, or',
    'even into words taken from the A vocabulary,',
    'but this usually demanded a long paraphrase',
    'and always involved the loss of certain overtones.',
    'The B words were a sort of verbal shorthand,',
    'often packing whole ranges of ideas into',
    'a few syllables, and at the same time more',
    'accurate and forcible than ordinary language.',
    'The B words were in all cases compound words.',
    '[Compound words such as SPEAKWRITE, were',
    'of course to be found in the A vocabulary,',
    'but these were merely convenient abbreviations',
    'and had no special ideological colour.] They',
    'consisted of two or more words, or portions',
    'of words, welded together in an easily pronounceable',
    'form. The resulting amalgam was always a',
    'noun-verb, and inflected according to the',
    'ordinary rules. To take a single example:',
    'the word GOODTHINK, meaning, very roughly,',
    '\'orthodoxy\', or, if one chose to regard it',
    'as a verb, \'to think in an orthodox manner\'.',
    'This inflected as follows: noun-verb, GOODTHINK;',
    'past tense and past participle, GOODTHINKED;',
    'present participle, GOOD-THINKING; adjective,',
    'GOODTHINKFUL; adverb, GOODTHINKWISE; verbal',
    'noun, GOODTHINKER. The B words were not constructed',
    'on any etymological plan. The words of which',
    'they were made up could be any parts of speech,',
    'and could be placed in any order and mutilated',
    'in any way which made them easy to pronounce',
    'while indicating their derivation. In the',
    'word CRIMETHINK (thoughtcrime), for instance,',
    'the THINK came second, whereas in THINKPOL',
    '(Thought Police) it came first, and in the',
    'latter word POLICE had lost its second syllable.',
    'Because of the great difficulty in securing',
    'euphony, irregular formations were commoner',
    'in the B vocabulary than in the A vocabulary.',
    'For example, the adjective forms of MINITRUE,',
    'MINIPAX, and MINILUV were, respectively,',
    'MINITRUTHFUL, MINIPEACEFUL, and MINILOVELY,',
    'simply because -TRUEFUL, -PAXFUL, and -LOVEFUL',
    'were slightly awkward to pronounce. In principle,',
    'however, all B words could inflect, and all',
    'inflected in exactly the same way. Some of',
    'the B words had highly subtilized meanings,',
    'barely intelligible to anyone who had not',
    'mastered the language as a whole. Consider,',
    'for example, such a typical sentence from',
    'a \'Times\' leading article as OLDTHINKERS',
    'UNBELLYFEEL INGSOC. The shortest rendering',
    'that one could make of this in Oldspeak would',
    'be: \'Those whose ideas were formed before',
    'the Revolution cannot have a full emotional',
    'understanding of the principles of English',
    'Socialism.\' But this is not an adequate translation.',
    'To begin with, in order to grasp the full',
    'meaning of the Newspeak sentence quoted above,',
    'one would have to have a clear idea of what',
    'is meant by INGSOC. And in addition, only',
    'a person thoroughly grounded in Ingsoc could',
    'appreciate the full force of the word BELLYFEEL,',
    'which implied a blind, enthusiastic acceptance',
    'difficult to imagine today; or of the word',
    'OLDTHINK, which was inextricably mixed up',
    'with the idea of wickedness and decadence.',
    'But the special function of certain Newspeak',
    'words, of which OLDTHINK was one, was not',
    'so much to express meanings as to destroy',
    'them. These words, necessarily few in number,',
    'had had their meanings extended until they',
    'contained within themselves whole batteries',
    'of words which, as they were sufficiently',
    'covered by a single comprehensive term, could',
    'now be scrapped and forgotten. The greatest',
    'difficulty facing the compilers of the Newspeak',
    'Dictionary was not to invent new words, but,',
    'having invented them, to make sure what they',
    'meant: to make sure, that is to say, what',
    'ranges of words they cancelled by their existence.',
    'As we have already seen in the case of the',
    'word FREE, words which had once borne a heretical',
    'meaning were sometimes retained for the sake',
    'of convenience, but only with the undesirable',
    'meanings purged out of them. Countless other',
    'words such as HONOUR, JUSTICE, MORALITY,',
    'INTERNATIONALISM, DEMOCRACY, SCIENCE, and',
    'RELIGION had simply ceased to exist. A few',
    'blanket words covered them, and, in covering',
    'them, abolished them. All words grouping',
    'themselves round the concepts of liberty',
    'and equality, for instance, were contained',
    'in the single word CRIMETHINK, while all',
    'words grouping themselves round the concepts',
    'of objectivity and rationalism were contained',
    'in the single word OLDTHINK. Greater precision',
    'would have been dangerous. What was required',
    'in a Party member was an outlook similar',
    'to that of the ancient Hebrew who knew, without',
    'knowing much else, that all nations other',
    'than his own worshipped \'false gods\'. He',
    'did not need to know that these gods were',
    'called Baal, Osiris, Moloch, Ashtaroth, and',
    'the like: probably the less he knew about',
    'them the better for his orthodoxy. He knew',
    'Jehovah and the commandments of Jehovah:',
    'he knew, therefore, that all gods with other',
    'names or other attributes were false gods.',
    'In somewhat the same way, the party member',
    'knew what constituted right conduct, and',
    'in exceedingly vague, generalized terms he',
    'knew what kinds of departure from it were',
    'possible. His sexual life, for example, was',
    'entirely regulated by the two Newspeak words',
    'SEXCRIME (sexual immorality) and GOODSEX',
    '(chastity). SEXCRIME covered all sexual misdeeds',
    'whatever. It covered fornication, adultery,',
    'homosexuality, and other perversions, and,',
    'in addition, normal intercourse practised',
    'for its own sake. There was no need to enumerate',
    'them separately, since they were all equally',
    'culpable, and, in principle, all punishable',
    'by death. In the C vocabulary, which consisted',
    'of scientific and technical words, it might',
    'be necessary to give specialized names to',
    'certain sexual aberrations, but the ordinary',
    'citizen had no need of them. He knew what',
    'was meant by GOODSEX, that is to say, normal',
    'intercourse between man and wife, for the',
    'sole purpose of begetting children, and without',
    'physical pleasure on the part of the woman:',
    'all else was SEXCRIME. In Newspeak it was',
    'seldom possible to follow a heretical thought',
    'further than the perception that it WAS heretical:',
    'beyond that point the necessary words were',
    'nonexistent. No word in the B vocabulary',
    'was ideologically neutral. A great many were',
    'euphemisms. Such words, for instance, as',
    'JOYCAMP (forced-labour camp) or MINIPAX (Ministry',
    'of Peace, i.e. Ministry of War) meant almost',
    'the exact opposite of what they appeared',
    'to mean. Some words, on the other hand, displayed',
    'a frank and contemptuous understanding of',
    'the real nature of Oceanic society. An example',
    'was PROLEFEED, meaning the rubbishy entertainment',
    'and spurious news which the Party handed',
    'out to the masses. Other words, again, were',
    'ambivalent, having the connotation \'good\'',
    'when applied to the Party and \'bad\' when',
    'applied to its enemies. But in addition there',
    'were great numbers of words which at first',
    'sight appeared to be mere abbreviations and',
    'which derived their ideological colour not',
    'from their meaning, but from their structure.',
    'So far as it could be contrived, everything',
    'that had or might have political significance',
    'of any kind was fitted into the B vocabulary.',
    'The name of every organization, or body of',
    'people, or doctrine, or country, or institution,',
    'or public building, was invariably cut down',
    'into the familiar shape; that is, a single',
    'easily pronounced word with the smallest',
    'number of syllables that would preserve the',
    'original derivation. In the Ministry of Truth,',
    'for example, the Records Department, in which',
    'Winston Smith worked, was called RECDEP,',
    'the Fiction Department was called FICDEP,',
    'the Teleprogrammes Department was called',
    'TELEDEP, and so on. This was not done solely',
    'with the object of saving time. Even in the',
    'early decades of the twentieth century, telescoped',
    'words and phrases had been one of the characteristic',
    'features of political language; and it had',
    'been noticed that the tendency to use abbreviations',
    'of this kind was most marked in totalitarian',
    'countries and totalitarian organizations.',
    'Examples were such words as NAZI, GESTAPO,',
    'COMINTERN, INPRECORR, AGITPROP. In the beginning',
    'the practice had been adopted as it were',
    'instinctively, but in Newspeak it was used',
    'with a conscious purpose. It was perceived',
    'that in thus abbreviating a name one narrowed',
    'and subtly altered its meaning, by cutting',
    'out most of the associations that would otherwise',
    'cling to it. The words COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL,',
    'for instance, call up a composite picture',
    'of universal human brotherhood, red flags,',
    'barricades, Karl Marx, and the Paris Commune.',
    'The word COMINTERN, on the other hand, suggests',
    'merely a tightly-knit organization and a',
    'well-defined body of doctrine. It refers',
    'to something almost as easily recognized,',
    'and as limited in purpose, as a chair or',
    'a table. COMINTERN is a word that can be',
    'uttered almost without taking thought, whereas',
    'COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL is a phrase over',
    'which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily.',
    'In the same way, the associations called',
    'up by a word like MINITRUE are fewer and',
    'more controllable than those called up by',
    'MINISTRY OF TRUTH. This accounted not only',
    'for the habit of abbreviating whenever possible,',
    'but also for the almost exaggerated care',
    'that was taken to make every word easily',
    'pronounceable. In Newspeak, euphony outweighed',
    'every consideration other than exactitude',
    'of meaning. Regularity of grammar was always',
    'sacrificed to it when it seemed necessary.',
    'And rightly so, since what was required,',
    'above all for political purposes, was short',
    'clipped words of unmistakable meaning which',
    'could be uttered rapidly and which roused',
    'the minimum of echoes in the speaker\'s mind.',
    'The words of the B vocabulary even gained',
    'in force from the fact that nearly all of',
    'them were very much alike. Almost invariably',
    'these words, GOODTHINK, MINIPAX, PROLEFEED,',
    'SEXCRIME, JOYCAMP, INGSOC, BELLYFEEL, THINKPOL,',
    'and countless others, were words of two or',
    'three syllables, with the stress distributed',
    'equally between the first syllable and the',
    'last. The use of them encouraged a gabbling',
    'style of speech, at once staccato and monotonous.',
    'And this was exactly what was aimed at. The',
    'intention was to make speech, and especially',
    'speech on any subject not ideologically neutral,',
    'as nearly as possible independent of consciousness.',
    'For the purposes of everyday life it was',
    'no doubt necessary, or sometimes necessary,',
    'to reflect before speaking, but a Party member',
    'called upon to make a political or ethical',
    'judgement should be able to spray forth the',
    'correct opinions as automatically as a machine',
    'gun spraying forth bullets. His training',
    'fitted him to do this, the language gave',
    'him an almost foolproof instrument, and the',
    'texture of the words, with their harsh sound',
    'and a certain wilful ugliness which was in',
    'accord with the spirit of Ingsoc, assisted',
    'the process still further. So did the fact',
    'of having very few words to choose from.',
    'Relative to our own, the Newspeak vocabulary',
    'was tiny, and new ways of reducing it were',
    'constantly being devised. Newspeak, indeed,',
    'differed from most all other languages in',
    'that its vocabulary grew smaller instead',
    'of larger every year. Each reduction was',
    'a gain, since the smaller the area of choice,',
    'the smaller the temptation to take thought.',
    'Ultimately it was hoped to make articulate',
    'speech issue from the larynx without involving',
    'the higher brain centres at all. This aim',
    'was frankly admitted in the Newspeak word',
    'DUCKSPEAK, meaning \'to quack like a duck\'.',
    'Like various other words in the B vocabulary,',
    'DUCKSPEAK was ambivalent in meaning. Provided',
    'that the opinions which were quacked out',
    'were orthodox ones, it implied nothing but',
    'praise, and when \'The Times\' referred to',
    'one of the orators of the Party as a DOUBLEPLUSGOOD',
    'DUCKSPEAKER it was paying a warm and valued',
    'compliment. THE C VOCABULARY. The C vocabulary',
    'was supplementary to the others and consisted',
    'entirely of scientific and technical terms.',
    'These resembled the scientific terms in use',
    'today, and were constructed from the same',
    'roots, but the usual care was taken to define',
    'them rigidly and strip them of undesirable',
    'meanings. They followed the same grammatical',
    'rules as the words in the other two vocabularies.',
    'Very few of the C words had any currency',
    'either in everyday speech or in political',
    'speech. Any scientific worker or technician',
    'could find all the words he needed in the',
    'list devoted to his own speciality, but he',
    'seldom had more than a smattering of the',
    'words occurring in the other lists. Only',
    'a very few words were common to all lists,',
    'and there was no vocabulary expressing the',
    'function of Science as a habit of mind, or',
    'a method of thought, irrespective of its',
    'particular branches. There was, indeed, no',
    'word for \'Science\', any meaning that it could',
    'possibly bear being already sufficiently',
    'covered by the word INGSOC. From the foregoing',
    'account it will be seen that in Newspeak',
    'the expression of unorthodox opinions, above',
    'a very low level, was well-nigh impossible.',
    'It was of course possible to utter heresies',
    'of a very crude kind, a species of blasphemy.',
    'It would have been possible, for example,',
    'to say BIG BROTHER IS UNGOOD. But this statement,',
    'which to an orthodox ear merely conveyed',
    'a self-evident absurdity, could not have',
    'been sustained by reasoned argument, because',
    'the necessary words were not available. Ideas',
    'inimical to Ingsoc could only be entertained',
    'in a vague wordless form, and could only',
    'be named in very broad terms which lumped',
    'together and condemned whole groups of heresies',
    'without defining them in doing so. One could,',
    'in fact, only use Newspeak for unorthodox',
    'purposes by illegitimately translating some',
    'of the words back into Oldspeak. For example,',
    'ALL MANS ARE EQUAL was a possible Newspeak',
    'sentence, but only in the same sense in which',
    'ALL MEN ARE REDHAIRED is a possible Oldspeak',
    'sentence. It did not contain a grammatical',
    'error, but it expressed a palpable untruth,',
    'i.e. that all men are of equal size, weight,',
    'or strength. The concept of political equality',
    'no longer existed, and this secondary meaning',
    'had accordingly been purged out of the word',
    'EQUAL. In 1984, when Oldspeak was still the',
    'normal means of communication, the danger',
    'theoretically existed that in using Newspeak',
    'words one might remember their original meanings.',
    'In practice it was not difficult for any',
    'person well grounded in DOUBLETHINK to avoid',
    'doing this, but within a couple of generations',
    'even the possibility of such a lapse would',
    'have vanished. A person growing up with Newspeak',
    'as his sole language would no more know that',
    'EQUAL had once had the secondary meaning',
    'of \'politically equal\', or that FREE had',
    'once meant \'intellectually free\', than for',
    'instance, a person who had never heard of',
    'chess would be aware of the secondary meanings',
    'attaching to QUEEN and ROOK. There would',
    'be many crimes and errors which it would',
    'be beyond his power to commit, simply because',
    'they were nameless and therefore unimaginable.',
    'And it was to be foreseen that with the passage',
    'of time the distinguishing characteristics',
    'of Newspeak would become more and more pronounced,',
    'its words growing fewer and fewer, their',
    'meanings more and more rigid, and the chance',
    'of putting them to improper uses always diminishing.',
    'When Oldspeak had been once and for all superseded,',
    'the last link with the past would have been',
    'severed. History had already been rewritten,',
    'but fragments of the literature of the past',
    'survived here and there, imperfectly censored,',
    'and so long as one retained one\'s knowledge',
    'of Oldspeak it was possible to read them.',
    'In the future such fragments, even if they',
    'chanced to survive, would be unintelligible',
    'and untranslatable. It was impossible to',
    'translate any passage of Oldspeak into Newspeak',
    'unless it either referred to some technical',
    'process or some very simple everyday action,',
    'or was already orthodox (GOODTHINKFUL would',
    'be the Newspeak expression) in tendency.',
    'In practice this meant that no book written',
    'before approximately 1960 could be translated',
    'as a whole. Pre-revolutionary literature',
    'could only be subjected to ideological translation,',
    'that is, alteration in sense as well as language.',
    'Take for example the well-known passage from',
    'the Declaration of Independence: WE HOLD',
    'THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT, THAT ALL',
    'MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, THAT THEY ARE ENDOWED',
    'BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN INALIENABLE',
    'RIGHTS, THAT AMONG THESE ARE LIFE, LIBERTY,',
    'AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. THAT TO SECURE',
    'THESE RIGHTS, GOVERNMENTS ARE INSTITUTED',
    'AMONG MEN, DERIVING THEIR POWERS FROM THE',
    'CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED. THAT WHENEVER ANY',
    'FORM OF GOVERNMENT BECOMES DESTRUCTIVE OF',
    'THOSE ENDS, IT IS THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE',
    'TO ALTER OR ABOLISH IT, AND TO INSTITUTE',
    'NEW GOVERNMENT. It would have been quite',
    'impossible to render this into Newspeak while',
    'keeping to the sense of the original. The',
    'nearest one could come to doing so would',
    'be to swallow the whole passage up in the',
    'single word CRIMETHINK. A full translation',
    'could only be an ideological translation,',
    'whereby Jefferson\'s words would be changed',
    'into a panegyric on absolute government.',
    'A good deal of the literature of the past',
    'was, indeed, already being transformed in',
    'this way. Considerations of prestige made',
    'it desirable to preserve the memory of certain',
    'historical figures, while at the same time',
    'bringing their achievements into line with',
    'the philosophy of Ingsoc. Various writers,',
    'such as Shakespeare, Milton, Swift, Byron,',
    'Dickens, and some others were therefore in',
    'process of translation: when the task had',
    'been completed, their original writings,',
    'with all else that survived of the literature',
    'of the past, would be destroyed. These translations',
    'were a slow and difficult business, and it',
    'was not expected that they would be finished',
    'before the first or second decade of the',
    'twenty-first century. There were also large',
    'quantities of merely utilitarian literature,',
    'indispensable technical manuals, and the',
    'like, that had to be treated in the same',
    'way. It was chiefly in order to allow time',
    'for the preliminary work of translation that',
    'the final adoption of Newspeak had been fixed',
    'for so late a date as 2050. THE END'

    'ERA UM DIA FRIO E ENSOLARADO DE ABRIL, E',
    'OS RELÓGIOS batiam treze horas. Winston',
    'Smith, o queixo fincado no peito numa tentativa',
    'de fugir ao vento impiedoso, esgueirou-se',
    'rápido pelas portas de vidro da Mansão',
    'Vitória; não porém com rapidez suficiente',
    'para evitar que o acompanhasse uma onda de',
    'pó áspero. O saguão cheirava a repolho',
    'cozido e a capacho de trapos. Na parede do',
    'fundo fora pregado um cartaz colorido, grande',
    'demais para exibição interna. Representava',
    'apenas uma cara enorme, de mais de um metro',
    'de largura: o rosto de um homem de uns quarenta',
    'e cinco anos, com espesso bigode preto e',
    'traços rústicos mas atraentes. Winston',
    'encaminhou-se para a escada. Inútil experimentar',
    'o elevador. Raramente funcionava, mesmo no',
    'tempo das vacas gordas, e agora a eletricidade',
    'era desligada durante o dia. Fazia parte',
    'da campanha de economia, preparatória da',
    'Semana do ódio. O apartamento ficava no',
    'sétimo andar e Winston, que tinha trinta',
    'e nove anos e uma variz ulcerada acima do',
    'tornozelo direito, subiu devagar, descansando',
    'várias vezes no caminho. Em cada patamar,',
    'diante da porta do elevador, o cartaz da',
    'cara enorme o fitava da parede. Era uma dessas',
    'figuras cujos olhos seguem a gente por toda',
    'parte. O GRANDE IRMÃO ZELA POR TI, dizia',
    'a legenda. Dentro do apartamento uma voz',
    'sonora lia uma lista de cifras relacionadas',
    'com a produção de ferro gusa. A voz saía',
    'de uma placa metálica retangular semelhante',
    'a um espelho fosco, embutido na parede direita.',
    'Winston torceu um comutador e a voz diminuiu',
    'um pouco, embora as palavras ainda fossem',
    'audíveis. O aparelho (chamava-se teletela)',
    'podia ter o volume reduzido, mas era impossível',
    'desligá-lo de vez. Winston foi até a',
    'janela: uma figura miúda, frágil, a magreza',
    'do corpo apenas realçada pelo macacão',
    'azul que era o uniforme do Partido. O cabelo',
    'era muito louro, a face naturalmente sanguínea,',
    'e a pele arranhada pelo sabão ordinário,',
    'as giletes sem corte e o inverno que mal',
    'terminara. Lá fora, mesmo através da',
    'vidraça fechada, o mundo parecia frio.',
    'Na rua, pequenos rodamoinhos de vento levantavam',
    'em pequenas aspirais poeira e papéis rasgados,',
    'e embora o sol brilhasse e o céu fosse',
    'dum azul berrante, parecia não haver cor',
    'em coisa alguma, salvo nos cartazes pregados',
    'em toda parte. O bigodudo olhava de cada',
    'canto. Havia um cartaz na casa defronte,',
    'O GRANDE IRMãO ZELA POR TI, dizia o letreiro,',
    'e os olhos escuros procuravam os de Winston.',
    'Ao nível da rua outro cartaz, rasgado num',
    'canto, trapejava ao vento, ora cobrindo ora',
    'descobrindo a palavra INGSOC. Na distância',
    'um helicóptero desceu beirando os telhados,',
    'pairou uns momentos como uma varejeira e',
    'depois se afastou num vôo em curva. Era',
    'a Patrulha da Polícia, espiando pelas janelas',
    'do povo. Mas as patrulhas não tinham importância.',
    'Só importava a Polícia do Pensamento.',
    'Por trás de \'Winston a voz da teletela',
    'ainda tagarelava a respeito do ferro gusa',
    'e da superação do Nono Plano Trienal.',
    'A teletela recebia e transmitia simultaneamente.',
    'Qualquer barulho que Winston fizesse, mais',
    'alto que um cochicho, seria captado pelo',
    'aparelho; além do mais, enquanto permanecesse',
    'no campo de visão da placa metálica,',
    'poderia ser visto também. Naturalmente,',
    'não havia jeito de determinar se, num dado',
    'momento, o cidadão estava sendo vigiado',
    'ou não. Impossível saber com que freqüência,',
    'ou que periodicidade, a Polícia do Pensamento',
    'ligava para a casa deste ou daquele individuo.',
    'Era concebível, mesmo, que observasse todo',
    'mundo ao mesmo tempo. A realidade é que',
    'podia ligar determinada linha, no momento',
    'que desejasse. Tinha-se que viver, e vivia-se',
    'por hábito transformado em instinto na',
    'suposição de que cada som era ouvido',
    'e cada movimento examinado, salvo quando',
    'feito no escuro. Winston continuou de costas',
    'para a teletela. Era mais seguro, conquanto',
    'até as costas pudessem falar. A um quilômetro',
    'dali o Ministério da Verdade, onde trabalhava,',
    'alteava-se, alvo e enorme, sobre a paisagem',
    'fuliginosa. Era isto, pensou ele com uma',
    'vaga repugnância, isso era Londres, cidade',
    'principal da Pista No 1, por sua vez a terceira',
    'entre as mais populosas províncias da Oceania.',
    'Tentou encontrar na memória uma recordação',
    'infantil que lhe dissesse se Londres sempre',
    'tivera aquele aspecto. Haviam existido sempre',
    'aquelas apodrecidas casas do século dezenove,',
    'os flancos reforçados com espeques de madeira,',
    'janelas com remendos de cartolina e os telhados',
    'com chapa de ferro corrugado, e os muros',
    'doidos dos jardins, descaindo em todas as',
    'direções? E as crateras de bombas onde',
    'o pó de reboco revoluteava no ar e o mato',
    'crescia à matroca sobre os montes de escombros;',
    'e os lugares onde as bombas haviam aberto',
    'clareiras maiores e tinham nascido sórdidas',
    'colônias de choças de madeira que mais',
    'pareciam galinheiros? Mas era inútil, não',
    'conseguia se lembrar: nada sobrava de sua',
    'infância, exceto uma série de quadros',
    'fortemente iluminados, que se sucediam sem',
    'pano de fundo e eram quase ininteligíveis.',
    'O Ministério da Verdade, ou Miniver, em',
    'Novilíngua, era completamente diferente',
    'de qualquer outro objeto visível. Era uma',
    'enorme pirâmide de alvíssimo cimento',
    'branco, erguendo-se, terraço sobre terraço,',
    'trezentos metros sobre o solo. De onde estava',
    'Winston conseguia ler, em letras elegantes',
    'colocadas na fachada, os três lemas do',
    'Partido: GUERRA é PAZ. LIBERDADE é ESCRAVIDãO.',
    'IGNORANCIA é FORçA. Constava que o Ministério',
    'da Verdade continha três mil aposentos',
    'sobre o nível do solo, e correspondentes',
    'ramificações no sub-solo. Espalhados',
    'por Londres havia outros três edifícios',
    'de aspecto e tamanho semelhantes. Dominavam',
    'de tal maneira a arquitetura circunjacente',
    'que do telhado da Mansão Vitória era',
    'possível avistar os quatro ao mesmo tempo.',
    'Eram as sedes dos quatro Ministérios que',
    'entre si dividiam todas as funções do',
    'governo: o Ministério da Verdade, que se',
    'ocupava das notícias, diversões, instrução',
    'e belas artes; o Ministério da Paz, que',
    'se ocupava da guerra; o Ministério do Amor,',
    'que mantinha a lei e a ordem; e o Ministério',
    'da Fartura, que acudia às atividades econômicas.',
    'Seus nomes, em Novilíngua: Miniver, Minipaz,',
    'Miniamo e Minifarto. O Ministério do Amor',
    'era realmente atemorizante. Não tinha janela',
    'alguma. Winston nunca estivera lá, nem',
    'a menos de um quilômetro daquele edifício.',
    'Era um prédio impossível de entrar, exceto',
    'em função oficial, e assim mesmo atravessando',
    'um labirinto de rolos de arame farpado, portas',
    'de aço e ninhos de metralhadoras. Até',
    'as ruas que conduziam às suas barreiras',
    'externas eram percorridas por guardas de',
    'cara de gorila e fardas negras, armados de',
    'porretes articulados. Winston voltou-se abruptamente.',
    'Afivelara no rosto a expressão de tranqüilo',
    'otimismo que era aconselhável usar quando',
    'de frente para a teletela. Atravessou o cômodo',
    'e entrou na cozinha minúscula. Saindo do',
    'Ministério àquela hora, sacrificara o',
    'almoço na cantina, e sabia que não havia',
    'na casa mais alimento que uma côdea de',
    'pão escuro, que seria a sua refeição',
    'matinal, no dia seguinte. Tirou da prateleira',
    'uma garrafa de líquido incolor com um rótulo',
    'branco em que se lia GIN VITÓRIA. Tinha',
    'um cheiro enjoado, oleoso, como de vinho',
    'de arroz chinês. Winston serviu-se de quase',
    'uma xícara de gin, contraiu-se para o choque',
    'e engoliu-a de vez, como uma dose de remédio.',
    'Instantaneamente, ficou com o rosto rubro,',
    'e os olhos começaram a lacrimejar. A bebida',
    'sabia a ácido nítrico, e ao bebê-la',
    'tinha-se a impressão exata de ter levado',
    'na nuca uma pancada com um tubo de borracha.',
    'No momento seguinte, porém, a queimação',
    'na barriga amainou e o mundo lhe pareceu',
    'mais ameno. Tirou um cigarro da carteira',
    'de CIGARROS VITóRIA e imprudentemente segurou-o',
    'na vertical, com que todo o fumo caiu ao',
    'chão. Puxou outro cigarro, com mais cuidado.',
    'Voltou à sala de estar e sentou-se a uma',
    'pequena mesa à esquerda da teletela. Da',
    'gaveta da mesa tirou uma caneta, um tinteiro,',
    'e um livro em branco, de lombo vermelho e',
    'capa de cartolina mármore. Por um motivo',
    'qualquer, a teletela da sala fora colocada',
    'em posição fora do comum. Em vez de ser',
    'colocada, como era normal, na parede do fundo,',
    'donde poderia dominar todo o aposento, fora',
    'posta na parede mais longa, diante da janela.',
    'A um dos seus lados ficava a pequena reentrância',
    'onde Winston estava agora sentado, e que,',
    'na construção do edifício, fora provavelmente',
    'destinada a uma estante de livros. Sentando-se',
    'nessa alcova, e mantendo-se junto à parede,',
    'Winston conseguia ficar fora do alcance da',
    'teletela, pelo menos no que respeitava à',
    'vista. Naturalmente, podia ser ouvido mas,',
    'contanto que permanecesse naquela posição,',
    'não podia ser visto. Em parte, fora a extraordinária',
    'topografia do cômodo que lhe sugerira o',
    'que agora se dispunha a fazer, Mas fora também',
    'sugerido pelo caderno que acabara de tirar',
    'da gaveta. Era um livro lindo. O papel macio,',
    'cor de creme, ligeiramente amarelado pelo',
    'tempo, era de um tipo que não se fabricava',
    'havia pelo menos quarenta anos. Era de ver,',
    'entretanto, que devia ser muito mais antigo.',
    'Vira-o na vitrina de um triste bricabraque',
    'num bairro pobre da cidade (não se lembrava',
    'direito do bairro) e fora acometido imediatamente',
    'do invencível desejo de possuí-lo. Os',
    'membros do Partido não deviam entrar em',
    'lojas comuns ("transacionar no mercado livre,"',
    'dizia-se), mas o regulamento não era estritamente',
    'obedecido, porque havia várias coisas,',
    'como cordões de sapatos e giletes, impossíveis',
    'de conseguir de outra forma. Relanceara o',
    'olhar pela rua e depois entrara, comprando',
    'o caderno por dois dólares e cinqüenta.',
    'Na ocasião, não tinha consciência de',
    'querê-lo para nenhum propósito definido.',
    'Levara-o para casa, às escondidas, na sua',
    'pasta. Mesmo sendo em branco, o papel era',
    'propriedade comprometedora. O que agora se',
    'dispunha a fazer era abrir um diário. Não',
    'era um ato ilegal (nada mais era ilegal,',
    'pois não havia mais leis), porém, se',
    'descoberto, havia razoável certeza de que',
    'seria punido por pena de morte, ou no mínimo',
    'vinte e cinco anos num campo de trabalhos',
    'forçados. Winston meteu a pena na caneta',
    'e chupou-a para tirar a graxa. A pena era',
    'um instrumento arcaico, raramente usada,',
    'mesmo em assinaturas, e ele conseguira uma,',
    'furtivamente, com alguma dificuldade, apenas',
    'por sentir que o belo papel creme merecia',
    'uma pena de verdade em vez de ser riscado',
    'por um lápis-tinta. Na verdade, não estava',
    'habituado a escrever a mão. Exceto recados',
    'curtíssimos, o normal era ditar tudo ao',
    'falascreve, o que naturalmente era impossível',
    'no caso. Molhou a pena na tinta e hesitou',
    'por um segundo. Um trernor lhe agitara as',
    'tripas. Marcar o papel era um ato decisivo.',
    'Com letra miúda e desajeitada escreveu:',
    '4 de abril de 1984 Encostou-se ao espaldar.',
    'Descera sobre ele uma sensação de completo',
    'desespero. Para começar, não sabia com',
    'a menor certeza se o ano era mesmo 1984.',
    'Devia ser mais ou menos isso, pois estava',
    'convencido de que tinha trinta e nove anos,',
    'e acreditava ter nascido em 1944 ou 45; hoje',
    'em dia, porém, não era nunca possível',
    'fixar uma data num ou dois anos. De repente',
    'ocorreu-lhe uma pergunta. Para quem estava',
    'escrevendo aquele diário? Para o futuro,',
    'os que não haviam nascido. Sua mente pairou',
    'um momento sobre a data duvidosa que escrevera',
    'e de repente se chocou contra a palavra duplipensar',
    'em Novilíngua. Pela primeira vez percebeu',
    'de todo a magnitude do que empreendera. Como',
    'poderia se comunicar com o futuro? Era impossível,',
    'pela própria natureza. Ou o futuro seria',
    'parecido com o presente, caso em que não',
    'lhe daria ouvidos, ou seria diferente, e',
    'nesse caso a sua situação não teria',
    'sentido. Por algum tempo ficou olhando o',
    'papel estupidamente. A teletela agora tocava',
    'estridente música militar. O curioso era',
    'que ele parecia não só ter perdido o',
    'poder de se exprimir como esquecido o que',
    'tinha em mente. Havia semanas que se preparava',
    'para aquele momento, e nunca lhe passara',
    'pela cabeça a idéia de precisar de mais',
    'que coragem. Escrever seria fácil. Tudo',
    'que tinha a fazer era transferir para o papel',
    'o intérmino e inquieto monólogo que se',
    'desenrolava na sua mente, fazia anos. Naquele',
    'momento, todavia, até o monólogo secara.',
    'Além disso, a variz comichava danadamente.',
    'E não ousava coçá-la, pois quando o',
    'fazia sempre inflamava. Os segundos passavam.',
    'De nada tinha consciência exceto da brancura',
    'do papel à sua frente, a coceira acima',
    'do tornozelo, o berreiro da música e uma',
    'leve bebedeira causada pelo gin. De repente,',
    'pôs-se a escrever por puro pânico, mal',
    'percebendo o que estava registrando. A letra',
    'miúda e infantil traçou linhas tortas',
    'pelo papel, abandonando primeiro as maiúsculas',
    'e depois até os pontos: 4 de abril de 1984.',
    'Ontem à noite ao cinema. Tudo fitas de',
    'guerra. Uma muito boa dum navio cheio de',
    'refugiados bombardeado no Mediterrâneo.',
    'Público muito divertido com cenas de um',
    'homenzarrão gordo tentando fugir nadando',
    'dum helicóptero. primeiro se via ele subindo',
    'descendo nágua que nem golfinho, depois',
    'pelas miras do helicóptero, e daí ficava',
    'cheio de buracos o mar perto ficava rosa',
    'e de repente afundava como se os furos tivessem',
    'deixado entrar água. público dando gargalhadas',
    'quando afundou. então viu-se um escaler',
    'cheio de crianças com um helicóptero',
    'por cima. havia uma mulher de meia idade',
    'talvez judia sentada na proa com um menininho',
    'duns três anos nos braços. garotinho',
    'gritando de medo e escondendo a cabeça',
    'nos seios dela como querendo se refugiar',
    'e mulher pondo os braços em torno dele',
    'e consolando apesar de também estar roxa',
    'de medo. todo tempo cobrindo ele o mais possível',
    'como se os braços pudessem protegê-lo',
    'das balas. então o helicóptero soltou',
    'uma bomba de 20 quilos em cima deles clarão',
    'espantoso e o bote virou cisco. daí uma',
    'ótima fotografia dum braço de criança',
    'subindo subindo subindo um helicóptero',
    'com a câmara no nariz deve ter acompanhado',
    'e houve muito aplauso no lugar do partido',
    'mas uma mulher da parte dos proles de repente',
    'armou barulho e começou gritar que não',
    'deviam exibir fita assim pras crianças',
    'não é direito na frente de crianças',
    'não e daí e tal até que a,polícia',
    'a botou na rua não acho que aconteceu nada',
    'para ela ninguém se importa com o que os',
    'proles dizem reação prole típica eles',
    'nunca. Winston parou de escrever, em parte',
    'por sentir cãibras na mão. Não sabia',
    'o que o levara a soltar aquela torrente de',
    'bobagem. O curioso, porém, é que, ao',
    'fazê-lo, uma recordação inteiramente',
    'diferente se esclarecera em sua memória,',
    'ao ponto de quase se sentir capaz de narrá-la.',
    'Percebia agora que fora por causa do outro',
    'incidente que de súbito resolvera ir para',
    'casa e iniciar o seu diário aquele dia.',
    'Sucedera aquela manhã no Ministério,',
    'se é possível dizer, que sucede algo',
    'tão nebuloso. Eram quase onze horas e no',
    'Departamento de Registro, onde Winston trabalhava,',
    'já arrastavam cadeiras dos cubículos',
    'e as arrumavam no centro do salão, diante',
    'da grande teletela, preparando-se para os',
    'Dois Minutos de ódio. Winston ia ocupando',
    'seu lugar numa das filas do meio quando entraram',
    'inesperadamente na sala duas pessoas que',
    'conhecia de vista, mas com quem nunca falara.',
    'Uma delas era uma moça com quem se encontrara',
    'muitas vezes nos corredores. Não sabia',
    'como se chamava, mas sabia que trabalhava',
    'no Departamento de Ficção. Era de presumir',
    '- pois a vira levando uma chave inglesa nas',
    'mãos sujas de graxa, que fosse mecânica',
    'de uma das máquinas de novelizar. Devia',
    'ter uns vinte e sete anos, e era de aparência',
    'audaciosa, com cabelo negro e espesso, rosto',
    'sardento e movimentos rápidos, atléticos.',
    'Uma estreita faixa escarlate, emblema da',
    'Liga Juvenil Anti-Sexo, dava várias voltas',
    'à sua cintura, o suficiente para realçar',
    'as curvas das ancas. Winston antipatizara',
    'com ela desde o primeiro momento. E sabia',
    'porquê. Era por causa da atmosfera de campos',
    'de hóquei, chuveiro frio, piqueniques e',
    'grande linha moral que conseguia inspirar.',
    'Ele antipatizava com todas as mulheres, principalmente',
    'com as moças e bonitas. Eram sempre as',
    'mulheres, e principalmente as moças, os',
    'militantes mais fervorosos do Partido, os',
    'devoradores de palavras de ordem, os espiões',
    'amadores e os espículas dos desvios. Esta',
    'jovem lhe dava a impressão de ser mais',
    'perigosa que a maioria. Uma vez que se haviam',
    'cruzado no corredor, ela lhe lançara um',
    'rápido olhar de esguelha que parecia tê-lo',
    'penetrado até o imo, e o enchera de terror.',
    'Até lhe ocorrera a idéia de que talvez',
    'fosse da Polícia do Pensamento. Na verdade,',
    'isso era pouco provável. Entretanto, continuava',
    'sentindo um estranho mal-estar, em cuja composição',
    'havia medo e hostilidade, e que sobrevinha',
    'sempre que ela sempre se aproximava. A outra',
    'pessoa era um homem chamado O\'Brien, membro',
    'do Partido Interno e ocupante de um posto',
    'tão remoto e de tamanha importância que',
    'Winston dele só tinha uma vaga idéia.',
    'Um silêncio momentâneo calou o grupo',
    'reunido em torno das cadeiras quando viu',
    'o macacão negro do Partido Interno. O\'Brien',
    'era um homem grande, troncudo, de pescoço',
    'taurino e rosto grosseiro, engraçado, brutal.',
    'Apesar da sua aparência temível tinha',
    'maneiras até distintas. Seu tique de re-',
    'arranjar os óculos no nariz, um gesto curioso,',
    'desarmava e, de certo modo indefinível',
    '- parecia civilizado. Era um gesto que, se',
    'alguém ainda pensasse em velharias tais,',
    'poderia recordar um fidalgo do século dezoito',
    'oferecendo a caixa de rapé. Winston vira',
    'O\'Brien talvez meia dúzia de vezes em outros',
    'tantos anos. Sentia-se fundamente atraído',
    'por ele, e não apenas por se sentir intrigado',
    'pelo contraste entre a urbanidade de O\'Brien',
    'e o seu físico de pugilista. Era muito',
    'mais por causa de uma crença secreta ou',
    'talvez não chegasse a crença, fosse mera',
    'esperança de que não era perfeita a ortodoxia',
    'política de O\'Brien. Havia em sua fisionomia',
    'algo que dava essa impressão. Ou ainda,',
    'talvez não fosse ortodoxia o que estava',
    'escrito em seu rosto, mas apenas inteligência.',
    'De qualquer forma, tinha o aspecto de ser',
    'pessoa com que se podia conversar, se fosse',
    'possível fraudar a teletela e falar-lhe',
    'a sós. Winston jamais fizera o menor esforço',
    'de verificar sua posição; na verdade,',
    'não havia maneira de o fazer. Naquele momento',
    'O\'Brien olhou o relógio-pulseira, viu que',
    'eram quase onze horas e evidentemente resolveu',
    'ficar no Departamento de Registro até acabarem',
    'os Dois Minutos de ódio. sentou-se numa',
    'cadeira da mesma fila que Winston, a dois',
    'passos dele. Entre os dois encontrava-se',
    'uma mulherzinha de cabelo cor de areia, que',
    'trabalhava no cubículo contíguo. A moça',
    'do cabelo escuro ocupou uma cadeira logo',
    'atrás. Mais um instante, e um guincho horrendo,',
    'áspero, como de uma máquina monstruosa',
    'funcionando sem óleo, saiu da grande teletela.',
    'Era um barulho de fazer ranger os dentes',
    'e arrepiar os cabelos da nuca. O ódio começara.',
    'Como de hábito, a face de Emmanuel Goldstein,',
    'o Inimigo do Povo, surgira na tela. Aqui',
    'e ali houve assovios entre o público. A',
    'mulherzinha de cabelo cor de areia emitiu',
    'um uivo misto de medo e repugnância. Goldstein',
    'era o renegado e traidor que um dia, muitos',
    'anos atrás (exatamente quantos ninguém',
    'se lembrava) fora uma das figuras de proa',
    'do Partido, quase no mesmo plano que o próprio',
    'Grande Irmão, tendo depois se dedicado',
    'a atividades contrarevolucionárias, sendo',
    'por isso condenado à morte, da qual escapara,',
    'desaparecendo misteriosamente. O programa',
    'dos Dois Minutos de ódio variava de dia',
    'a dia, sem que porém Goldstein deixasse',
    'de ser o personagem central cotidiano. Era',
    'o traidor original, o primeiro a conspurcar',
    'a pureza do Partido. Todos os subseqüentes',
    'crimes contra o Partido, todas as traições,',
    'atos de sabotagem, heresias, desvios, provinham',
    'diretamente dos seus ensinamentos. Nalguma',
    'parte do mundo ele continuava vivo e tramando',
    'suas conspirações: talvez no além-mar,',
    'sob proteção dos seus patrões estrangeiros;',
    'talvez até mesmo, de vez em quando corria',
    'o boato, nalgum esconderijo na própria',
    'Oceania. Winston sentiu contrair-se o diafragma.',
    'Nunca podia ver a face de Goldstein sem uma',
    'dolorosa mistura de emoções. Era um rosto',
    'judaico, magro, com um grande halo de cabelo',
    'branco esgrouviado e um pequeno cavanhaque',
    '- um rosto arguto e no entanto, de certo',
    'modo, intrinsecamente desprezível, com',
    'um ar de tolice senil no nariz comprido e',
    'fino no qual se equilibravam os óculos.',
    'Parecia a cara duma ovelha, e a voz também',
    'recordava um balido. Goldstein lançava',
    'o costumeiro ataque peçonhento às doutrinas',
    'do Partido, um ataque tão exagerado e',
    'perverso que uma criança poderia refutá-lo,',
    'e no entanto suficientemente plausível',
    'para encher o cidadão de alarme, de receio',
    'que outras pessoas menos equilibradas o pudessem',
    'aceitar. Insultava o Grande Irmão, denunciava',
    'a ditadura do Partido, exigia a imediata',
    'conclusão da paz com a Eurásia, advogava',
    'a liberdade de palavra, a liberdade de imprensa,',
    'a liberdade de reunião, a liberdade de',
    'pensamento, gritava histericamente que a',
    'revolução fora traída, e tudo numa',
    'linguagem rápida, polissilábica, que',
    'era uma espécie de paródia do estilo',
    'habitual dos oradores do Partido, e até',
    'continha palavras em Novilíngua: maior',
    'número dessas palavras, com efeito, do',
    'que qualquer membro do Partido usaria na',
    'vida diária. E todo o tempo, para que não',
    'persistissem dúvidas quanto à realidade',
    'oculta pela lenga- lenga especiosa de Goldstein,',
    'marchavam por trás de sua cabeça, na',
    'teletela, infindas colunas do exército',
    'eurasiano, fileiras após fileiras de homens',
    'sólidos com rostos asiáticos, sem expressão,',
    'que vinham até a superfície da placa',
    'e sumiam, para ser seguidos por outros exatamente',
    'idênticos. O ritmo cavo e monótono das',
    'botas dos soldados formava uma cortina sonora',
    'para os balidos de Goldstein. Antes do ódio',
    'se haver desenrolado por trinta segundos,',
    'metade dos presentes soltava incontroláveis',
    'exclamações de fúria. Era demais, suportar',
    'a vista daquela cara de ovelha satisfeita',
    'e do poderio terrífico do exército eurasiano,',
    'mostrado na tela: além disso, ver ou mesmo',
    'pensar em Goldstein produzia automaticamente',
    'medo e raiva. Era objeto de ódio mais constante',
    'que a Eurásia ou a Lestásia porquanto,',
    'quando a Oceania estava em guerra com uma',
    'dessas potencias, em geral estava em paz',
    'com a outra. O estranho, todavia, é que',
    'embora Goldstein fosse odiado e desprezado',
    'por todo mundo, embora todos os dias, e milhares',
    'de vezes por dia, nas tribunas, teletelas,',
    'jornais, livros, suas teorias fossem refutadas,',
    'esmagadas, ridicularizadas, apresentadas',
    'aos olhos de todos como lixo atoa. e apesar',
    'de tudo isso, sua influência nunca parecia',
    'diminuir. Havia sempre novos bocós esperando',
    'para ser seduzidos. Não se passava dia',
    'sem que espiões e sabotadores, obedientes',
    'a ordens dele, não fossem desmascarados',
    'pela Polícia do Pensamento. Era comandante',
    'de um vasto exército de sombras, uma rede',
    'subterrânea de conspiradores dedicados',
    'à derrocada do Estado. Supunha-se que se',
    'chamava a Fraternidade. Murmurava-se também',
    'a respeito de um livro terrível, um compêndio',
    'de todas as heresias, escrito por Goldstein,',
    'e que circulava clandestinamente aqui e ali.',
    'Era um livro sem título. Referiam-se a',
    'ele, simplesmente, por o livro. Mas só',
    'se sabia dessas coisas através de vagos',
    'boatos. Nem a Fraternidade nem o livro eram',
    'assuntos que um militante comum do Partido',
    'mencionasse. No segundo minuto o ódio chegou',
    'ao frenesi. Os presentes pulavam nas cadeiras,',
    'e berravam a plenos pulmões, esforçando-se',
    'para abafar a voz alucinante que saía da',
    'tela. A mulherzinha do cabelo de areia ficara',
    'toda rosa, e abria e fechava a boca como',
    'peixe jogado à terra. Até o rosto másculo',
    'de O\'Brien estava corado. Estava sentado',
    'muito teso na sua cadeira, o peito largo',
    'se alteando e agitando como se resistisse',
    'ao embate duma vaga. A morena atrás de',
    'Winston pusera-se a berrar "Porco! Porco!',
    'Porco!" De repente, apanhou um pesado dicionário',
    'de Novilíngua e atirou-o à tela. O livro',
    'atingiu o nariz de Goldstein e ricochetou;',
    'a voz continuou, inexorável. Num momento',
    'de lucidez, Winston percebeu que ele também',
    'estava gritando com os outros e batendo os',
    'calcanhares violentamente contra a travessa',
    'da cadeira. O horrível dos Dois Minutos',
    'de ódio era que embora ninguém fosse',
    'obrigado a participar, era impossível deixar',
    'de se reunir aos outros. Em trinta segundos',
    'deixava de ser preciso fingir. Parecia percorrer',
    'todo o grupo, como uma corrente elétrica,',
    'um horrível êxtase de medo e vindita,',
    'um desejo de matar, de torturar, de amassar',
    'rostos com um malho, transformando o indivíduo,',
    'contra a sua vontade, num lunático a uivar',
    'e fazer caretas. E no entanto, a fúria',
    'que se sentia era uma emoção abstrata,',
    'não dirigida, que podia passar de um alvo',
    'a outro como a chama dum maçarico. Assim,',
    'havia momentos em que o ódio de Winston',
    'não se dirigia contra Goldstein mas, ao',
    'invés, contra o Grande Irmão, o Partido',
    'e a Polícia do Pensamento; e nesses momentos',
    'o seu coração se aproximava do solitário',
    'e ridicularizado herege da tela, o único',
    'guardião da verdade e da sanidade num mundo',
    'de mentiras. No entanto, no instante seguinte',
    'se irmanava com os circunstantes, e tudo',
    'quanto se dizia de Goldstein lhe parecia',
    'verdadeiro. Nesses momentos, o seu ódio',
    'secreto pelo Grande Irmão se transformava',
    'em adoração, e o Grande Irmão parecia',
    'crescer, protetor destemido e invencível,',
    'firme como uma rocha contra as hordes da',
    'ásia, e Goldstein, apesar do seu isolamento,',
    'sua fraqueza e da dúvida que cercava a',
    'sua própria existência, lhe parecia um',
    'hipnotizador sinistro, capaz de destruir',
    'a estrutura da civilização pelo mero',
    'poder da voz. Nesses momentos era até possível',
    'dirigir o ódio neste ou naquele rumo, por',
    'ato voluntário. De repente, por uma espécie',
    'desse esforço violento com que, num pesadelo,',
    'se arranca a cabeça do travesseiro, Winston',
    'conseguiu transferir para a moça de cabelo',
    'escuro, sentada atrás dele, o ódio que',
    'antes dedicava à figura da tela. Belas',
    'e vívidas alucinações lhe atravessaram',
    'o cérebro. Haveria de matá-la a golpes',
    'de um cajado de borracha. Amarra-la-ia nua',
    'a um poste e a crivaria de flechas como São',
    'Sebastião. Possui-la-ia e a degolaria no',
    'momento do gozo. Além disso, percebeu mais',
    'claro que antes porque a odiava. Odiava-a',
    'porque era jovem, bonita e assexuada, porque',
    'desejava ir para a cama com ela, e porque',
    'nunca o faria, porque na cinturinha fina',
    'e convidativa, que parecia pedir que a segurassem',
    'com o braço, só havia a odiosa faixa',
    'escarlate, o agressivo símbolo de castidade.',
    'O ódio chegou ao clímax. A voz de Goldstein',
    'transformara-se de fato num balido de ovelha,',
    'e por um instante o rosto se transformou',
    'numa cara de carneiro. Depois a cara de carneiro',
    'se fundiu na de um soldado eurasiano que',
    'parecia avançar, enorme e terrível, com',
    'a metralhadora de mão rugindo, parecendo',
    'saltar da superfície da tela, de modo tão',
    'real que alguns da primeira fileira se inclinaram',
    'para trás. No mesmo momento, porém, arrancando',
    'um fundo suspiro de alívio de todos, a',
    'figura hostil fundiu-se na fisionomia do',
    'Grande Irmão, de cabelos e bigodes negros,',
    'cheio de força e de misteriosa calma, e',
    'tão vasta que tomava quase toda a tela.',
    'Ninguém ouviu o que o Grande Irmão disse.',
    'Eram apenas palavras de incitamento, o tipo',
    'das palavras que se pronunciam no vivo do',
    'combate, palavras que não se distinguem',
    'individualmente mas que restauram a confiança',
    'pelo fato de serem ditas. Então o rosto',
    'do Grande Irmão sumiu de novo e no seu',
    'lugar apareceram as três divisas do Partido,',
    'em maiúsculas, em negrito: GUERRA é PAZ',
    'LIBERDADE é ESCRAVIDãO IGNORâNCIA é',
    'FORçA Mas o rosto do Grande Irmão pareceu',
    'persistir por vários segundos na tela,',
    'como se o seu impacto nas pupilas fosse forte',
    'demais para se esmaecer tão rápido. A',
    'mulherzinha do cabelo cor de areia atirara-se',
    'sobre o espaldar da cadeira que tinha à',
    'frente. Com um murmúrio trêmulo que parecia',
    'dizer "Meu Salvador", extendeu os braços',
    'para a tela. Depois ocultou a face nas mãos.',
    'Era claro que orava. Nesse momento, todo',
    'o grupo se pôs a entoar um cantochão',
    'ritmado "G.I.!G.I.! . G.I.!" repetido',
    'inúmeras vezes, comumalongapausaentreoGeoI',
    '-umsomcavoesurdo, curiosamente selvagem,',
    'no fundo do qual se parecia ouvir batidas',
    'de pés nus e o rufo dos atabaques. Durou',
    'meio minuto talvez. Era um estribilho que',
    'se ouvia com freqüência nos momentos',
    'de emoção dominadora. Era em parte um',
    'hino à sapiência e majestade do Grande',
    'Irmão porém, mais que isso, era auto-hipnotismo,',
    'o afogar deliberado da consciência por',
    'meio do barulho rítmico. As entranhas de',
    'Winston pareceram esfriar. Durante os Dois',
    'Minutos de ódio, não era possível deixar',
    'de participar do delírio geral, mas aquele',
    'cântico sub-humano "G.I.! . G.I.!" sempre',
    'o enchia de pavor. Naturalmente, cantava',
    'com os outros: seria impossível proceder',
    'doutra forma. Dominar os sentimentos, controlar',
    'as feições, fazer o que todo mundo fazia,',
    'era uma reação instintiva. Havia porém',
    'um lapso de dois segundos em que a expressão',
    'de seus olhos poderia traí-lo. E foi exatamente',
    'nesse lapso que a coisa sucedera, se é',
    'que de fato sucedera. Momentaneamente, seu',
    'olhar encontrara o de O\'Brien, que se erguera.',
    'Tirara os óculos e ia colocá-los no lugar,',
    'com um gesto característico. Mas houve',
    'uma fração de segundo em que os olhares',
    'se encontraram e, enquanto durou, Winston',
    'viu, sim, viu!, que O\'Brien estava pensando',
    'o mesmo que ele. Completara-se uma inequívoca',
    'comunicação. Fora como se os dois espíritos',
    'se abrissem e os pensamentos de um passassem',
    'ao outro, pelos olhos. "Estou contigo," pareceu',
    'dizer-lhe O\'Brien. "Sei exatamente o que',
    'sentes. Sei tudo de teu desprezo, teu ódio,',
    'teu nojo. Mas não te aflijas, estou a teu',
    'lado!" E daí sumira-se a faísca de inteligência',
    'e a face de O\'Brien se tornara inescrutável',
    'como a de todos. Fora tudo, e ele já nem',
    'tinha a certeza de que de fato acontecera.',
    'Tais incidentes jamais tinham seqüela.',
    'Tudo que faziam era manter viva, dentro dele,',
    'a fé, ou a esperança, de que houvesse',
    'outros inimigos do Partido. Afinal de contas,',
    'talvez fossem verdadeiros os boatos de vastas',
    'conspirações subterrâneas, quiçá',
    'existisse mesmo a Fraternidade! Era impossível,',
    'não obstante as infindas prisões, confissões',
    'e execuções, ter a certeza de que a Fraternidade',
    'não passava de invencionice. Alguns dias',
    'ele acreditava, outros não. Não havia',
    'provas, apenas visões fugidias que podiam',
    'significar algo ou nada: trechos de conversa',
    'entreouvida, rabiscos apagados nas paredes',
    'das privadas, e uma vez, até, no encontro',
    'de dois desconhecidos, um pequeno movimento',
    'de mãos que talvez fosse um sinal identificador.',
    'Era tudo palpite: provavelmente imaginara',
    'a coisa. Voltou ao cubículo sem tornar',
    'a olhar para O\'Brien. Mal lhe passara pela',
    'cabeça a idéia de aprofundar o contacto',
    'momentâneo. Seria inconcebivelmente perigoso,',
    'mesmo que soubesse como agir. Durante um',
    'segundo, dois, haviam trocado um olhar equívoco,',
    'e era o fim da história. Mas até aquilo',
    'era um acontecimento memorável, na solidão',
    'amuralhada em que se era obrigado a viver.',
    'Winston levantou-se e acomodou-se melhor',
    'na cadeira. Soltou um arroto. Era o gin que',
    'lhe subia do estômago. Seus olhos tornaram',
    'a focar a página. Descobriu que estivera',
    'escrevendo, num gesto automático, ao mesmo',
    'tempo que a memória divagava. E não era',
    'mais a letra desajeitada e miúda de antes.',
    'A pena correra voluptuosamente sobre o papel',
    'macio, escrevendo em grandes letras de imprensa:',
    'ABAIXO o GRANDE IRMãO ABAIXO o GRANDE IRMãO',
    'ABAIXO o GRANDE IRMãO ABAIXO o GRANDE IRMãO',
    'ABAIXO o GRANDE IRMãO muitíssimas vezes,',
    'enchendo meia página. Não pôde deixar',
    'de sentir um laivo de pânico. Era absurdo,',
    'pois escrever aquelas palavras não era',
    'mais perigoso que o ato inicial de abrir',
    'o diário, mas,por um momento se sentiu',
    'tentado a rasgar as páginas usadas e abandonar',
    'por completo a empresa. Não o fez, contudo,',
    'porque sabia ser inútil. Quer escrevesse',
    'ABAIXO O GRANDE IRMãO ou não, não fazia',
    'diferença. Quer continuasse o diário,',
    'quer parasse, não fazia diferença. A',
    'Polícia do Pensamento o apanharia do mesmo',
    'modo. Cometera, e teria cometido, nem que',
    'não levasse a pena ao papel, o crime essencial,',
    'que em si continha todos os outros. Crimidéia,',
    'chamava-se. O crimidéia não era coisa',
    'que pudesse ocultar. Podia-se escapar com',
    'êxito algum tempo, anos até, porém',
    'mais cedo ou mais tarde pegavam o criminoso.',
    'E era sempre à noite, as prisões eram',
    'sempre à noite. O súbito arranco ao sono,',
    'a mão rude sacudindo o ombro, as luzes',
    'ferindo os olhos, o círculo de caras implacáveis',
    'em torno da cama. Na vasta maioria dos casos',
    'não havia julgamento, nem notícia da',
    'prisão. As pessoas simplesmente desapareciam,',
    'sempre durante a noite. O nome do cidadão',
    'era removido dos registros, suprimida toda',
    'menção dele, negada sua existência',
    'anterior, e depois esquecido. Era-se abolido,',
    'aniquilado; vaporizado era o termo corriqueiro.',
    'Winston foi dominado por breve ataque de',
    'histeria. Pôsse a escrever em garranchos',
    'apressados: me darão um tiro que mimporta',
    'me darão um tiro na nuca não mimporta',
    'abaixo o grande irmão eles sempre dão',
    'tiro na nuca que mimporta abaixo o grande',
    'irmão Ergueu-se um pouco na cadeira, ligeiramente',
    'envergonhado de si próprio, e largou a',
    'caneta. Dali a um segundo levou um susto',
    'enorme. Batiam à porta. Já?! Deixou-se',
    'ficar, quieto como um camondongo, na esperança',
    'vã de que a pessoa se fosse sem insistir.',
    'Mas não, a batida repetiu-se. Seria pior',
    'atrasar-se. Com o coração batendo como',
    'um tambor, mas com a face provavelmente',
    'sem expressão, graças ao velho hábito',
    '- ele se levantou e encaminhou-se para a',
    'porta a passos tardos. 2 Quando pôs a mão',
    'no trinco viu que deixara o diário aberto',
    'na mesa. ABAIXO O GRANDE IRMãO lia-se em',
    'toda a página, em letras quase visíveis',
    'da porta, de tão grandes. Cometera um erro',
    'incrivelmente estupido. Percebeu, entretanto,',
    'que mesmo no seu pânico não quisera sujar',
    'o belo papel creme fechando o caderno sobre',
    'a tinta fresca. Respirou fundo e abriu a',
    'porta. Instantaneamente, uma vaga de alívio',
    'o dominou. Uma mulher incolor, insignificante,',
    'de cabelo ralo e pele encarquilhada, surgiu',
    'no vão. Oh, camarada, disse, num gemido',
    'soturno, ouvi tua chegada. Achas que podes',
    'vir dar uma olhada na minha pia da cozinha?',
    'Entupiu. Era a sra. Parsons, esposa de',
    'um vizinho do mesmo andar. ("Sra. era termo',
    'um tanto antipatizado pelo Partido, o correto',
    'era chamar todo mundo de "camarada", mas',
    'com certas mulheres era usado instintivamente.)',
    'Teria uns trinta anos, mas parecia muito',
    'mais velha. Dava a impressão de ter poeira',
    'nas rugas. Winston seguiu-a pelo corredor.',
    'êsses consertos amadores eram uma chatice',
    'quase diária. A Mansão Vitória era',
    'um prédio antigo, construido por volta',
    'de 1930, e estava caindo aos pedaços. O',
    'reboco vivia caindo às placas das paredes',
    'e do forro, os canos arrebentavam com qualquer',
    'geada, havía goteiras sempre que nevava',
    'um pouco, o sistema de aquecimento em geral',
    'funcionava a meio-vapor quando não o fechavam',
    'de vez, para economizar combustível. Os',
    'concertos, exceto os que os próprios inquilinos',
    'pudessem executar, dependiam da sanção',
    'de remotos comités, capazes de adiar dois',
    'anos a substituição duma vidraça quebrada.',
    '- é só porque o Tom não está, explicou',
    'a sra. Parsons vagamente. O apartamento dos',
    'Parsons era maior que o de Winston, e lúgubre',
    'de outra maneira. Tudo tinha um aspecto pisado,',
    'amassado, como se a casa acabasse de ser',
    'visitada por um animal violento. Acessórios',
    'esportivos, tacos de hóquei, luvas de',
    'boxe, uma bola furada, um par de shorts suados',
    'virados pelo avesso, jaziam no soalho, e',
    'sobre a mesa havia uma pilha de pratos sujos',
    'e de cadernos de exercício, sebentos e',
    'orelhudos. Nas paredes viam-se bandeiras',
    'escarlates da Liga da Juventude e dos Espiões,',
    'e um cartaz tamanho natural do Grande Irmão.',
    'Pairava no ar o costumeiro cheiro de repolho',
    'cozido, comum a todo o edifício, mas ali',
    'misturado com a catinga mais pronunciada',
    'de suor, percebia- se isto à primeira',
    'cheirada, embora fosse difícil explicar',
    'como- de suor de uma pessoa ausente. Noutra',
    'sala alguém, com um pente e um pedaço',
    'de papel higiênico, estava tentando acompanhar',
    'a música militar que ainda saía da teletela.',
    '- São as crianças, disse a sra. Parsons,',
    'lançando uma olhada apreensiva para a porta.',
    '- Não sairam hoje. E naturalmente. Tinha',
    'o hábito de interromper as frases no meio.',
    'A pia da cozinha estava cheia até quase',
    'em cima duma água esverdeada, imunda, que',
    'fedia a repolho, mais que nunca. Winston',
    'ajoelhou-se e examinou o sifão. Tinha raiva',
    'de usar as mãos, e detestava abaixar-se,',
    'o que em geral lhe provocava tosse. A sra.',
    'Parsons ficou olhando, sem préstimo. -',
    'Naturalmente, se Tom estivesse em casa, consertaria',
    'num momento, disse ela., Ele gosta desses',
    'serviços. é tão jeitoso, Tom. Parsons',
    'era colega de Winston no Ministério da',
    'Verdade. Era um homem gorducho mas ativo,',
    'de estupidez paralisante, uma massa de entusiasmo',
    'imbecil, um dêsses servos dedicados e',
    'absolutamente fiéis dos quais dependia',
    'a estabilidade do Partido, mais do que da',
    'Polícia do Pensamento. Aos trinta e cinco',
    'fora a contragosto desligado da Liga da Juventude',
    'e antes de entrar para ela conseguira ficar',
    'nos Espiões um ano além da idade limite.',
    'No Ministério, trabalhava num serviço',
    'subordinado, para o que não precisava de',
    'inteligência, mas por outro lado era figura',
    'de proa no Comité Esportivo e em todos',
    'os outros comités empenhados na organização',
    'de piqueniques e passeatas comunais, demonstrações',
    'espontâneas, campanhas de economia e atividades',
    'voluntárias em geral. Informava ao interlocutor,',
    'com tranquilo orgulho, soltando baforadas',
    'do cachimbo, que comparecera ao Centro Comunal',
    'todas as noites, nos últimos quatro anos.',
    'Um tremendo cheiro de suor, uma espécie',
    'de testemunho inconsciente da dureza de sua',
    'vida, seguia-o por tôda parte, e permanecia',
    'no ambiente mesmo depois dele sair., Tens',
    'uma chave inglesa?, indagou Winston, apalpando',
    'a porca do sifão., Chave?, exclamou a',
    'sra. Parson, tornando-se invertebrada outra',
    'vez., Não sei não. Quem sabe as crianças.',
    'Houve um estrondo de botinas e outro guincho',
    'no pente, recordando a presença das crianças',
    'na sala de estar. A sra. Parsons trouxe a',
    'chave inglesa. Winston soltou a água e',
    'com nojo retirou \'o bolo de cabelo humano',
    'que entupira o cano. Lavou os dedos da melhor',
    'maneira possível na água fria da pia',
    'e voltou para a sala., Mãos ao ar!, urrou',
    'uma voz selvagem. Um menino bonito, de uns',
    'nove anos e cara de brigão, surgira por',
    'trás da mesa e o ameaçava com uma pistola',
    'automática de brinquedo, imitado por sua',
    'irmãzinha, de sete, e que empunhava um',
    'pedaço de madeira. Ambos vestiam calções',
    'azuis, camisas cinzentas e o lenço vermelho',
    'que compunham o uniforme dos Espiões. Winston',
    'levantou as mãos sobre a cabeça, mas',
    'com mal-estar, tão viciosa era a atitude',
    'do garoto, que não lhe parecia pilhéria.',
    '- és um traidor!, berrou o menino., és',
    'um ideocriminoso! és um espião eurasiano.',
    'Eu te mato, te vaporizo, te mando para as',
    'minas de sal! De repente, puseram-se os dois',
    'a saltar em torno dele, berrando "traidor!"',
    'e "ideocriminoso!", a menininha imitando',
    'todos os movimentos do irmão. Era um tanto',
    'arrepiante, como um brinquedo de filhotes',
    'de tigre, que breve serão devoradores de',
    'homens. Havia nos olhos do menino uma espécie',
    'de ferocidade calculadora, um desejo bastante',
    'evidente de esmurrar ou dar um pontapé',
    'em Winston, e a consciência de ter quase',
    'o tamanho necessário para a agressão.',
    'Ainda bem que não brandia uma pistola de',
    'verdade, pensou Winston. Os olhos da vizinha',
    'saltaram nervosamente de Winston às crianças,',
    'e vice-versa. Sob a luz mais forte da sala',
    'de estar ele notou com interêsse que de',
    'fato havia pó nas rugas do seu rosto. -',
    'Ficam tão barulhentos,, disse ela., Estão',
    'desapontados porque não puderam assistir',
    'ao enforcamento, é isso. Não tenho tempo',
    'para levá-los, e Tom não voltará do',
    'serviço a tempo., Por que não podemos',
    'ir ver o enforcamento?, indagou o menino,',
    'num vozeirão., Quero vê o forcamento!',
    'Quero vê o forcamento!, cantarolou a garota,',
    'saltitando pelo cômodo. Deviam ser enforcados',
    'aquela noite, no Parque, uns prisioneiros',
    'eurasianos, criminosos de guerra. Isso acontecia',
    'uma vez por mês e era um grande espetáculo',
    'popular. As crianças sempre exigiam que',
    'as levassem. Winston despediu-se da sra.',
    'Parsons e encaminhou\'-se para a porta. Mas',
    'ainda não dera seis passos pelo corredor',
    'quando um projétil o acertou na nuca, numa',
    'pancada muito dolorosa. Foi como se um arame',
    'em brasa o tivesse atingido. Girou nos calcanhares',
    'a tempo de ver a sra. Parsons arrastando',
    'o filho para a sala de estar, enquanto o',
    'menino metia no bolso um estilingue., Goldstein!',
    '- estertorou o menino quando a porta se fechou.',
    'O que mais impressionou Winston, contudo,',
    'foi o olhar de terror inerme da mulherzinha',
    'de cara gris. De volta ao apartamento, passou',
    'rápido diante da teletela e tornou a sentar-se',
    'à mesa, ainda esfregando o pescoço. Cessara',
    'a música. Substituira-a uma voz militar,',
    'que em tom stacccato lia, com gôzo brutal,',
    'uma descrição dos armamentos da nova',
    'Fortaleza Flutuante que acabava de ser ancorada',
    'entre a Islândia e as Ilhas Faroe. Com',
    'aquelas horrendas crianças, pensou, essa',
    'pobre mulher deve levar uma vida de terror.',
    'Dali a um ano, ou dois, começarão a observá-la',
    'dia e noite, à cata de sintomas de heterodoxia.',
    'Quase todas as crianças eram horríveis.',
    'O pior de tudo é que, com auxílio de',
    'organizações tais como os Espiões,',
    'eram sistemàticamente transformadas em',
    'pequenos selvagens incontroláveis, e no',
    'entanto nelas não se produzia qualquer',
    'tendência de se rebelar contra a disciplina',
    'do Partido. Ao contrário, adoravam o Partido,',
    'e tudo quanto tinha ligação com ele.',
    'As canções, as procissões, as bandeiras,',
    'as caminhadas. a ordem unida com fusis de',
    'madeira, berrar palavras de ordem, adorar',
    'o Grande Irmão, era para elas uma espécie',
    'de jogo formidável. Toda sua ferocidade',
    'era posta para fora, dirigida contra os inimigos',
    'do Estado, contra os forasteiros, traidores,',
    'sabotadores, ideocriminosos. Era quase normal',
    'que as pessoas de mais de trinta tivessem',
    'medo aos próprios filhos. E com fartos',
    'motivos, pois rara era a semana em que o',
    'Times não publicasse um tópico contando',
    'Como um pequeno salafrário, "herói infantil"',
    'era a expressão usada, ouvira alguma observação',
    'comprometedora e denunciara os pais à Polícia',
    'do Pensamento. A picada do estilingue não',
    'doía mais. Winston segurou a caneta, desanimado,',
    'indagando de seus botões se encontraria',
    'mais o que registrar no diário. De repente,',
    'começou a pensar outra vez em O\'Brien.',
    'Anos atrás, quantos anos? Devia ser uns',
    'sete, sonhara estar caminhando num quarto',
    'escuro como breu. E alguém, sentado ao',
    'seu lado, dissera ao senti-lo passar: "Tornaremos',
    'a nos encontrar onde não há treva." Fora',
    'dito baixinho, sem ênfase, uma declaração,',
    'não uma ordem. E ele continuara, sem parar.',
    'O curioso é que, na ocasião, no sonho,',
    'as palavras não o haviam impressionado',
    'maiormente. Sómente mais tarde, e aos poucos,',
    'é que tinham ganho em significação.',
    'Não podia lembrar agora se fora antes ou',
    'depois do sonho que vira O\'Brien pela primeira',
    'vez; nem se lembrava de quando identificara',
    'aquela voz como a de O\'Brien. Fosse como',
    'fosse, existia a identificação. O\'Brien',
    'lhe falara na escuridão. Winston nunca',
    'conseguira ter certeza, mesmo depois do',
    'cintilar de olhares daquela manhã ainda',
    'era impossível ter certeza, da amizade',
    'ou inimizade de O\'Brién. Nem lhe parecera',
    'ter muita importância. Entre eles havia',
    'um laço de compreensão mais importante',
    'do que o afeto ou a ideologia. "Tornaremos',
    'a nos encontrar onde não há treva", dissera',
    'ele. Winston não sabia o que significava,',
    'apenas acreditava que, de um modo ou outro,',
    'seria realidade. A voz da teletela fez uma',
    'pausa. Um toque de clarim, belo e límpido,',
    'flutuou no ar estagnado. A voz continuou,',
    'áspera:, Atenção! Atenção, por',
    'favor! Acaba de chegar uma notícia da frente',
    'de Malabar. Nossas forças do Sul da índia',
    'lograram uma gloriosa vitória. Estou autorizado',
    'a dizer que essa batalha poderá aproximar',
    'a guerra do seu fim. Eis a notícia. Más',
    'notícias, pensou Winston. E com efeito,',
    'depois de uma sanguinolenta descrição',
    'do aniquilamento de um exército eurasiano,',
    'com formidáveis cifras de mortos e prisioneiros,',
    'divulgou-se a notícia de que, a partir',
    'da semana próxima, a ração de chocolate',
    'seria reduzida de trinta a vinte gramas.',
    'Winston tornou a arrotar. O gin estava-se',
    'gastando, deixando uma sensação de vazio.',
    'A teletela, talvez para celebrar a vitória,',
    'talvez para afogar a lembrança do chocolate',
    'perdido, atacou "Oceania, nossa terra."',
    'Era dever de todos ouvirem o hino de pé.',
    'Todavia, na posição em que estava, não',
    'podiam vê- lo. A "Oceania, nossa terra,"',
    'seguiu-se música mais leve, Winston foi',
    'até a janela, sempre de costas para a tela.',
    'O dia continuava claro e despejado. Nalgum',
    'lugar distante uma bomba-foguete explodiu',
    'com um estrondo surdo, ecoante. Atualmente,',
    'caíam em Londres, vinte ou trinta bombas',
    'por semana. Lá embaixo, na rua, o vento',
    'ainda fustigava o cartaz rasgado, e a palavra',
    'INGSOC ora aparecia ora desaparecia. Ingsoc.',
    'Os princípios sagrados do Ingsoc. Novilíngua,',
    'duplepensar, a mutabilidade do passado. Sentiu-se',
    'como quem vagueia nas florestas do fundo',
    'do mar, perdido num mundo monstruoso onde',
    'ele próprio era o monstro. Estava só.',
    'O passado morto, o futuro inimaginável.',
    'Que certeza haveria de estar ao seu lado',
    'uma única criatura humana viva? E de que',
    'maneira saber que o domínio do Partido',
    'não duraria para sempre? Como resposta,',
    'os três lemas da fachada branca do Ministério',

    'o indivíduo, a voz a envolvê-lo. Adormecido',
    'ou desperto, trabalhando ou comendo, dentro',
    'e fora de casa, no banheiro ou na cama -',
    'não havia fuga. Nada pertencia ao indivíduo,',
    'com exceção de alguns centímetros cúbicos',
    'dentro do crânio. O sol deslocara-se no',
    'céu e, na sombra, as miríades de janelas',
    'do Ministério da Verdade pareciam as sinistras',
    'seteiras de uma fortaleza. O coração',
    'de Winston tremeu ante a pirâmide enorme.',
    'Era forte demais -não podia ser tomada',
    'de assalto. Mil bombas-foguetes não a deitariam',
    'por terra. Tornou a indagar de si próprio:',
    'para quem estaria escrevendo o diário?',
    'Para o futuro, para o passado, para uma',
    'época que talvez fosse imaginária- E',
    'diante dele abria-se não a morte, mas o',
    'aniquilamento. O diário seria reduzido',
    'a cinzas e ele a vapor. Sómente a Polícia',
    'do Pensamento leria o seu escrito, antes',
    'de suprimi-lo e eliminá-lo da lembrança.',
    'Como poderia apelar para o futuro sendo impossível',
    'a sobrevivência física de um vestígio',
    'do indivíduo, e até mesmo de uma palavra',
    'anônima rabiscada num pedaço de papel?',
    'A teletela assinalou catorze horas. Precisava',
    'sair dali a dez minutos. Tinha de estar de',
    'volta ao serviço às catorze e trinta.',
    'Curiosamente, o soar das horas pareceu dar-lhe',
    'novo ânimo. Ele não passava dum fantasma',
    'solitário exprimindo uma verdade que ninguém',
    'jamais ouviria. Mas enquanto a exprimisse,',
    'a continuidade não seria interrompida.',
    'Não é fazendo ouvir a nossa voz mas permanecendo',
    'são de mente que preservamos a herança',
    'humana. Ele voltou à mesa, molhou a pena',
    'e escreveu: Ao futuro ou ao passado, a uma',
    'época em que o pensamento seja livre, em',
    'que os homens sejam diferentes uns dos outros',
    'e que não vivam sós, a uma época em',
    'que a verdade existir e o que foi feito não',
    'puder ser desfeito: Cumprimentos da era de',
    'uniformidade, da era da solidão, da era',
    'do Grande Irmão, da era do duplipensar!',
    'Ele já estava morto, refletiu. Pareceu-lhe',
    'que só agora, depois de começar á formular',
    'suas idéias, dera o passo decisivo. As',
    'consequencias de cada ato são incluidas',
    'no próprio ato. Escreveu: Crimidéia não',
    'acarreta a morte: crimidéia é a morte.',
    'Agora que se reconhecia como defunto, tornava-se',
    'importante ficar vivo o mais tempo possível.',
    'Tinha manchados de tinta dois dedos da mão',

    'que podia traí-lo. Algum enxerido do Ministério',
    '(mulher, provavelmente; alguém como aquela',
    'zinha de cabelo cor de areia ou a morena',
    'do Departamento de Ficção) poderia querer',
    'saber por que andara escrevendo na hora do',
    'almôço, por que usara uma pena antiga,',
    'o que escrevera, e então soltar um palpite',
    'no local competente. Winston foi ao banheiro',
    'e cuidadosamente lavou a tinta, com o sabão',
    'áspero, arenoso e escuro, que arranhava',
    'como lixa e que portanto era ótimo para',
    'o que tinha em vista. Guardou o diário',
    'na gaveta. Era absolutamente inútil pensar',
    'em escondê-lo, mas poderia ao menos certificar-se',
    'de que sua existência fora ou não descoberta.',
    'Um cabelo deposto na margem da página daria',
    'na vista. Com a ponta do dedo recolheu um',
    'grão identificável de pó esbranquieçado',
    'e depositou-o no canto da capa, donde certamente',
    'cairia se o livro fosse mexido. 3 Winston',
    'sonhava com sua mãe. Devia ter uns dez',
    'ou onze anos quando sua mãe desaparecera.',
    'E \'ra alta, estatuesca, meio calada, de movimentos',
    'vagarosos e magnífico cabelo claro. Do',
    'pai lembrava-se mais vagamente. Era moreno',
    'e magro, vestia sempre roupas escuras, bem',
    'postas (Winston lembrava-se vivamente das',
    'solas finas dos sapatos do pai), e usava',
    'óculos. Os dois deviam, evidentemente,',
    'ter sido tragados num dos grandes expurgos',
    'de 1950-60. Naquele momento porém sua mãe',
    'estava sentada à frente dele, num lugar',
    'fundo, com a filhinha nos braços. Ele não',
    'se lembrava da irmã senão como um nenêzinho',
    'fraco, sempre calado, de olhos grandes e',
    'vigilantes. Ambas o fitavam. Encontravam-se',
    'nalgum subterrâneo, no fundo de um poço,',
    'ou numa tumba muito profunda, mas era um',
    'lugar que, apesar de já ser muito mais',
    'baixo, submergia ainda e cada vez mais. Estavam',
    'no salão de um navio que naufragava, e',
    'olhavam para ele através da água que',
    'escurecia. Ainda havia ar no salão; elas',
    'podiam vê-lo e ele a elas, mas todo tempo',
    'as duas continuavam afundando, baixando nas',
    'águas verdes que dentro de alguns momentos',
    'as ocultariam para sempre. Ele se encontrava',
    'no claro, e com ar, enquanto elas eram absorvidas',
    'pela morte, e estavam no fundo por causa',
    'dele estar ali. Ele sabia disso, elas sabiam,',
    'e era visível que sabiam. Mas não havia',
    'censura nem na fisionomia nem no coração',
    'das duas, apenas a certeza de que deviam',
    'morrer para que ele continuasse vivo, e que',
    'aquilo era parte da ordem inevitável das',
    'coisas. Não podia lembrar-se do quê sucedera,',
    'mas sabia no sonho que, dum modo ou doutro,',
    'a vida de sua mãe e de sua irmã tinham',
    'sido sacrificadas pela dele. Era um dêsses',
    'sonhos que, embora retenham o cenário onírico',
    'característico, são a continuação',
    'da vida intelectual do indivíduo, e no',
    'qual toma conhecimento de fatos e idéias',
    'que mesmo depois de acordar ainda parecem',
    'novos e valiosos. A coisa que agora impressionava',
    'Winston de repente era que a morte de sua',
    'mãe, quase trinta anos atrás, fora trágica',
    'e tristonha, de um modo que não seria mais',
    'possível. Ele percebia que a tragédia',
    'pertencia ao tempo antigo, a uma época',
    'em que havia ainda vida privada, amor e amizade,',
    'e em que os membros duma família amparavam',
    'uns aos outros sem indagar razões. A lembrança',
    'de sua mãe maguava-lhe o coração porque',
    'ela morrera amando-o, numa época em que',
    'ele era criança e egoista demais para corresponder-lhe',
    'e porque, de certo modo, que ele não recordava,',
    'ela se sacrificara a uma concepção de',
    'lealdade particular e inalterável. Ele',
    'via que tais coisas não mais podiam acontecer.',
    'Hoje o que havia era medo, ódio, dor, porém',
    'nenhuma dignidade de emoção, nenhuma',
    'mágua profunda ou complexa. Tudo isto lhe',
    'pareceu ver nos grandes olhos de sua mãe',
    'e sua irmã, olhando-o através da água',
    'verde em que afundavam, centenas de braças',
    'abaixo donde ele estava. De repente encontrou-se',
    'num relvado fofo e curto, numa noite estival,',
    'em que os raios oblíquos do sol ainda douravam',
    'o chão. A paisagem que contemplava aparecia',
    'tanto em seus sonhos que nunca podia ter',
    'certeza de a ter visto ou não no mundo',
    'real. Desperto, chamava-a de Terra Dourada.',
    'Era um velho pasto estragado pelos coelhos,',
    'com uma picada que serpeava de um lado a',
    'outro, e pontilhado de cupins. Na sebe maltratada,',
    'do outro lado do campo, os ramos dos ulmeiros',
    'balouçavam de leve na brisa, e suas folhas',
    'palpitavam em densas massas, como cabelo',
    'de mulher. Por ali perto, embora invisível,',
    'havia um regato límpido e lento, em que',
    'nadavam os mugens, nos espraiados à sombra',
    'dos chorões. A moça do cabelo escuro',
    'vinha ao encontro dele, atravessando o campo.',
    'Com o que pareceu a Winston um único movimento,',
    'ela arrancou as roupas e atirou-as desdenhosamente',
    'para o lado. Tinha o corpo alvo e macio,',
    'mas não lhe despertou desejo; na verdade,',
    'mal o olhou. O que o possuia naquele instante',
    'era admiração pelo gesto com que atirara',
    'as roupas de lado. Com sua graça e displicência',
    'parecia aniquilar uma cultura inteira, todo',
    'um sistema de pensamento, como se o Grande',
    'Irmão, o Partido e a Polícia do Pensamento',
    'pudessem ser lançados ao nada por um gesto',
    'símples e esplêndido. Aquele também',
    'era um gesto que Pertencia aos tempos antigos.',
    'E Winston despertou com a palavra "Shakespeare"',
    'nos lábios. A teletela estava soltando',
    'Um apito ensurdecedor, que continuou no mesmo',
    'tom durante uns trinta segundos. Eram sete',
    'e quinze, hora de se levantarem os empregados',
    'de escritórios. Winston arrancou o corpo',
    'da cama, nú, porquanto um membro do Partido',
    'Externo só recebia três mil cupões',
    'do racionamento de roupas por ano, e as duas',
    'peças de um pijama exigiam seiscentos -',
    'e apanhou uma camiseta suja e um par de cuecas',
    'que colocara numa cadeira próxima. A Educação',
    'Física começaria dentro de três minutos.',
    'No momento seguinte foi presa de violento',
    'acesso de tosse, que quase sempre o atacava',
    'pouco depois de levantar. Esvaziava-lhe os',
    'pulmões de tal forma que só podia recomeçar',
    'a respirar deitando-se de costas e aspirando',
    'fundo uma porção de vezes. As veias tinham',
    'inchado com o esfôrço da tosse, e a variz',
    'ulcerada começou a coçar., Grupo de',
    'trinta a quarenta!, bradou uma aguda voz',
    'feminina., Grupo de trinta a quarenta! Tomai',
    'vossos lugares, por favor. De trinta a quarenta!',
    'Winston ficou em posição de sentido diante',
    'do aparelho, onde já aparecera a imagem',
    'de uma moça magricela porém musculosa,',
    'metida em uniforme e sapatos de ginástica.',
    '- Dobrar e esticar os braços!, ordenou.',
    '- Acompanhai o meu ritmo. Um, dois, três,',
    'quatro! Um, dois, três, quatro! Vamos,',
    'camaradas, um pouco de vida nisso! Um, dois,',
    'três, quatro! Um, dois, três, quatro!',
    'A dor do acesso de tosse não afugentara',
    'inteiramente do espírito de Winston a impressão',
    'produzida pelo sonho, e de certo modo os',
    'movimentos rítmicos do exercício a reavivaram.',
    'Enquanto atirava mecanicamente os braços',
    'para frente e para trás, afivelando no',
    'rosto o ar de carrancudo prazer que se considerava',
    'recomendável durante a Educação Física,',
    'lutava para recordar-se do período obscuro',
    'da infância. Era extraordinàriamente',
    'difícil. Do acontecido antes de 1960, tudo',
    'desbotara. Não havia anais a que fazer',
    'referência, e portanto até o fio da vida',
    'pessoal perdia nitidez. Lembrava- se de momentosos',
    'acontecimentos que com toda probabilidade',
    'não tinham tido lugar, recordava-se dos',
    'pormenores de incidentes sem conseguir recapturar-lhes',
    'a atmosfera, e havia longos períodos em',
    'branco, aos quais nada podia atribuir. Tudo',
    'então fora diferente. Tinham sido diferentes',
    'até os nomes de países, e suas formas',
    'no mapa. A Pista N.o 1 não tinha êsse',
    'nome naquela época: chamava-se Inglaterra,',
    'ou Grã- Bretanha, embora Londres, disso',
    'tinha certeza quase absoluta, sempre tivesse',
    'sido Londres. Winston não podia lembrar',
    'definitivamente uma época em que o país',
    'não estivesse em guerra, mas era evidente',
    'um intervalo de paz bastante longo durante',
    'a sua infância, porque uma das suas mais',
    'longínqüas recordações era de um',
    'bombardeio aéreo que parecera a todos surpreender.',
    'Fora talvez quando a bomba atômica caira',
    'em Colchester. Não se lembrava do bombardeio',
    'em si, mas lembrava-se do pai a segurar-lhe',
    'a mão com força, enquanto corriam para',
    'um lugar nas profundezas da terra, dando',
    'voltas e voltas numa escada espiral que fazia',
    'ruido sob seus pés e que por fim lhe cansou',
    'tanto as pernas que ele começou a choramingar',
    'e pararam para descansar. Sua mãe, com',
    'modos lentos e sonhadores, seguia-os a grande',
    'distância. Levava nos braços a menina',
    '- ou talvez fossem apenas cobertores: Winston',
    'não tinha certeza da garota já ser nascida.',
    'Por fim tinham ido dar num lugar atulhado',
    'e barulhento, que verificou ser uma estação',
    'do trem subterrâneo. Havia gente sentada',
    'no chão de lagedo, e outros, muito apertadinhos,',
    'sentavam-se em catres metálicos, arrumados',
    'como beliches. Winston, mãe e pai, encontraram',
    'um lugar, perto dum velho e duma velha sentados',
    'num catre. O velho vestia um terno escuro,',
    'de boa qualidade e boné de pano preto na',
    'cabeça toda branca. Tinha o rosto escarlate,',
    'e os olhos azuis cheios de lágrimas. Fedia',
    'a gin. Parecia porejá-lo pela pele, em',
    'vez de suor, e podia-se imaginar fossem puro',
    'álcool as lágrimas que lhe cresciam nos',
    'olhos. Entretanto, apesar de ligeiramente',
    'bêbedo, sofria uma dor genuina e insuportável.',
    'Com sua percepção infantil, Winston viu',
    'que algo terrível, que não tinha perdão',
    'nem remédio, acabara de suceder. Pareceu-lhe',
    'também saber do que se tratava. Morrera',
    'no bombardeio alguém que o velho amava;',
    'uma netinha talvez. A curtos intervalos,',
    'o velho repetia:, Não deviamo tê comfiança',
    'neles. Eu te disse, Mãe, não disse? Foi',
    'nisso que deu tê confiança neles. Foi',
    'o que eu sempre disse. Não deviamo tê',
    'confiança nos sacana. Mas quais sacanas',
    'não mereciam confiança, Winston já',
    'não se lembrava. Desde mais ou menos aquela',
    'época, a guerra fora literalmente contínua,',
    'embora, a rigor, não fosse sempre a mesma',
    'guerra. Durante vários meses, durante sua',
    'meninice, houvera confusas lutas de rua na',
    'própria Londres, e de algumas ele se recordava',
    'vivamente. Mas seguir a história de todo',
    'o período, dizer quem lutava, contra quem,',
    'em determinado momento, seria absolutamente',
    'impossível, já que nenhum registro escrito,',
    'nem palavra oral, jamais faziam menção',
    'de outro alinhamento de forças, diferente',
    'do atual. Naquele momento, por exemplo, em',
    '1984 (se é que era 1984), a Oceania estava',
    'em guerra com a Eurásia e era aliada da',
    'Lestásia. Em nenhuma manifestação pública',
    'ou particular se admitia jamais que as três',
    'potências se tivessem agrupado diferentemente.',
    'Na verdade, como Winston se recordava muito',
    'bem, fazia apenas quatro anos a Oceania estivera',
    'em guerra com a Lestásia e em aliança',
    'com a Eurásia. Isso, porém, não passava',
    'de um naco de conhecimento furtivo, que ele',
    'possuía porque a sua memória não era',
    'satisfatoriamente controlada. Oficialmente,',
    'a mudança de aliados jamais tivera lugar.',
    'A Oceania estava em guerra com a Eurásia:',
    'portanto, a Oceania sempre estivera em guerra',
    'com a Eurásia. O inimigo do momento representava',
    'sempre o mal absoluto, daí decorrendo a',
    'impossibilidade de qualquer acordo passado',
    'ou futuro com ele. O espantoso, refletiu',
    'pela décima milésima vez, ao forçar',
    'os ombros dolorosamente para trás (mãos',
    'nas cadeiras, fazia girar o corpo pela cintura,',
    'exercício que se acreditava fazer bem aos',
    'músculos dorsais), o espantoso é que',
    'pode mesmo ser verdade. Se o Partido tem',
    'o poder de agarrar o passado e dizer que',
    'êste ou aquele acontecimento nunca se verificou',
    '- não é mais aterrorizante do que a simples',
    'tortura e a morte? O Partido dizia que a',
    'Oceania jamais fora aliada da Eurásia.',
    'Ele, Winston Smith, sabia que a Oceania fora',
    'aliada da Eurásia não havia senão quatro',
    'anos. Onde, porém, existia êsse conhecimento?',
    'Apenas em sua consciência, o que em todo',
    'caso devia ser logo aniquilada. E se todos',
    'os outros aceitassem a mentira imposta pelo',
    'Partido, se todos os anais dissessem a mesma',
    'coisa, então a mentira se transformava',
    'em história, em verdade. "Quem controla',
    'o passado," dizia o lema do Partido, "controla',
    'o futuro: quem controla o presente controla',
    'o passado." E no entanto o passado, conquanto',
    'de natureza alterável, nunca fora alterado.',
    'O que agora era verdade era verdade do sempre',
    'ao sempre. Era bem simples. Bastava apenas',
    'uma série infinda de vitórias sobre a',
    'memória. "Controle da realidade," chamava-se.',
    'Ou, em Novilíngua, "duplipensar.", Descansar!',
    '- latiu a instrutora, um pouco mais benévola.',
    'Winston deixou cair os braços e lentamente',
    'tornou a encher os pulmões de ar. Seu espírito',
    'mergulhou no mundo labiríntico do duplipensar.',
    'Saber e não saber, ter consciência de',
    'completa veracidade ao exprimir mentiras',
    'cuidadosamente arquitetadas, defender simultaneamente',
    'duas opiniões opostas, sabendo-as contraditórias',
    'e ainda assim acreditando em ambas; usar',
    'a lógica contra a lógica, repudiar a',
    'moralidade em nome da moralidade, crer na',
    'impossibilidade da democracia e que o Partido',
    'era o guardião da democracia; esquecer',
    'tudo quanto fosse necessário esquecer,',
    'trazê-lo à memória prontamente no momento',
    'preciso, e depois torná-lo a esquecer;',
    'e acima de tudo, aplicar o próprio processo',
    'ao processo. Essa era a sutileza derradeira:',
    'induzir conscientemente a inconsciência,',
    'e então, tornar-se inconsciente do ato',
    'de hipnose que se acabava de realizar. Até',
    'para compreender a palavra "duplipensar"',
    'era necessário usar o duplipensar. Nesse',
    'momento a instrutora chamou-os de nova à',
    'ginástica., Vamos ver quem de nós é',
    'capaz de tocar a ponta dos pés!, disse,',
    'com entusiasmo, Sem dobrar os joelhos, camaradas,',
    'só a cintura. Um-dois! Um-dois! Winston',
    'odiava êsse exercício, que lhe produzia',
    'dores nas pernas, desde os tornozelos até',
    'as nádegas e não raro lhe provocava acessos',
    'de tosse. O ar semi-agradável sumiu de',
    'suas meditações. O passado, refletiu,',
    'não apenas fora alterado, fora efetivamente',
    'destruido. Por que, como estabelecer até',
    'mesmo o fato mais patente, se não havia',
    'dele registro, além do da memória? Tentou',
    'recordar-se do ano em que ouvira pela primeira',
    'vez falar do Grande Irmão. Achou que deveria',
    'ter sido na década de 1960 a 70, mas era',
    'impossível ter certeza. Nas histórias',
    'do Partido, o Grande Irmão naturalmente',
    'figurava como chefe e guardião da Revolução,',
    'desde o princípio. Suas elocubrações',
    'tinham aos poucos recuado no tempo até',
    'atingir o mundo fabuloso de 1930 a 50, éPoca',
    'em que os capitalistas, com estranhos chapéus',
    'cilíndricos, ainda rodavam pelas ruas de',
    'Londres em grandes e brilhantes automóveis',
    'ou carruagens com janelas de vidro. Não',
    'era Possível saber até onde essa lenda',
    'era verdade e até onde era invenção.',
    'Winston não podia lembrar-se nem da data',
    'em que o Partido viera à luz. Não acreditava',
    'ter ouvido a palavra Ingsoc antes de 1960,',
    'mas era provável que na sua forma antiga,',
    'em Antilíngua, "Socialismo inglês" -',
    'fosse corrente antes daquele ano. Tudo se',
    'fundia na névoa. As vezes, porém, podia',
    'colocar o dedo numa mentira definida. Não',
    'era verdade, por exemplo, como afirmavam',
    'os livros de história do Partido, que o',
    'Partido tivesse inventado o aeroplano. Lembrava-se',
    'de aviões desde a mais tenra idade. Mas',
    'não podia provar nada. Nunca havia prova.',
    'Apenas uma vez, em toda sua vida, tinha tido',
    'em mãos prova documental inconfundível',
    'da falsificação de um fato histórico.',
    'E naquela ocasião., Smith!, gritou',
    'da teletela a voz da megera., 6079 Smith',
    'W! Tu, tu mesmo! Inclina-te mais, por favor.',
    'Podes fazer mais que isso. Não, não estás',
    'te esforçando. Mais baixo! Assim está',
    'melhor, camarada. Agora, todo mundo, descansar!',
    'Olhai para mim. Um calor quente e súbito',
    'dominou todo o corpo de Winston. O rosto',
    'continuou inescrutável. Jamais revelar',
    'desânimo! Jamais revelar ressentimento!',
    'Um simples olhar podia denunciá-lo. Ficou',
    'olhando a instrutora levantar os braços',
    'acima da cabeça e, não se podia dizer',
    'com graça mas com notável decisão e',
    'eficiência, inclinar-se e meter a falangeta',
    'sob os artelhos., Pronto, camaradas! é',
    'isto que vos quero ver fazer. Olhai de novo.',
    'Estou com trinta e nove anos e tive quatro',
    'filhos. Olhai., Inclinou-se de novo, Vêde,',
    'que não dobro os joelhos! Todos podeis',
    'fazer, se quizerdes,, acrescentou, enquanto',
    'se levantava., Com menos de quarenta e cinco,',
    'qualquer um pode tocar a ponta dos pés.',
    'Não temos todos o privilégio de lutar',
    'nas linhas da frente, mas pelo menos podemos',
    'conservar a linha e a saúde. Lembrai-vos',
    'dos rapazes da frente de Malabar! E dos marinheiros',
    'das Fortalezas Flutuantes! Pensai no que',
    'eles têm de suportar. Vamos tentar de',
    'novo. Agora está melhor, camarada, muito',
    'melhor!, ajuntou, animando-o, quando Winston,',
    'num tranco violento, conseguiu tocar os pés',
    'sem dobrar os joelhos, pela primeira vez',
    'em vários anos. 4 Com o suspiro profundo',
    'e inconsciente que nem mesmo a proximidade',
    'da teletela podia impedir, ao iniciar o dia',
    'de trabalho, Winston puxou para perto o falascreve,',
    'soprou a poeira do bocal e colocou os óculos.',
    'Depois desenrolou e grampeou quatro pequenos',
    'rolos de papel que haviam caido do tubo pneumático',
    'à direita da mesa. Nas paredes do cubículo',
    'havia três orifícios. à direita do',
    'falascreve, um pequeno tubo pneumático',
    'para mensagens escritas; à esquerda, outro',
    'maior, para jornais; e no meio, bem ao alcance',
    'do braço de Winston, uma grande abertura',
    'retangular protegida por uma grade de arame.',
    'Destinava-se ao desembaraço de papéis',
    'servidos. Aberturas idênticas existiam',
    'aos milhares, ou às dezenas de milhares',
    'em todo o edifício, não apenas nas salas,',
    'como a pequenos intervalos, nos corredores.',
    'Por um motivo qualquer, haviam sido apelidados',
    'de buracos da memória. Quando se sabia',
    'que algum documento devia ser destruido,',
    'ou mesmo quando se via um pedaço de papel',
    'usado largado no chão, era gesto instintivo,',
    'automático, levantar a tampa do mais próximo',
    'buraco da memória e jogar o papel dentro',
    'dele para que fosse sugado pela corrente',
    'de ar morno, até as caldeiras enormes,',
    'ocultas nalguma parte, nas entranhas do prédio.',
    'Winston examinou as quatro tiras de papéis',
    'que havia desenrolado. Cada uma continha',
    'um recado de apenas uma ou duas linhas, na',
    'jíria abreviada, não se tratava só',
    'de Novilíngua, porém continha principalmente',
    'palavras nesse idioma, utilizada no Ministério',
    'para comunicações internas. Diziam: times',
    '17.3.84 gi disc malrepro africa retifica',
    'times 19.12.83 previsão 3 ac 4.o trimestre',
    '83 errata verifica número hoje times 14.2.84',
    'minifarto malnotícia chocolate retifica',
    'times 3.12.83 notícia ordemdia gi dupliplusimbom',
    'refs impessoas reescreve compl subsuper prearquivo.',
    'Com um ligeiro sentimento de satisfação,',
    'Winston colocou de lado o quarto bilhete.',
    'Era um trabalho complexo e de responsabilidade,',
    'que seria melhor deixar por último. Os',
    'outros três eram simples questão de rotina,',
    'conquanto o segundo talvez exigisse uma tediosa',
    'pesquisa de cifras. Winston discou "números',
    'atrasados" na teletela e pediu os exemplares',
    'correspondentes do Times, que escorregaram',
    'da boca do tubo pneumático depois de uns',
    'minutos de espera. As mensagens recebidas',
    'referiam-se a artigos ou notícias que,',
    'por um motivo ou outro, deviam ser alterados',
    'ou, como se dizia oficialmente, retificados.',
    'Por exemplo, o Times de dezessete de março',
    'publicara que o Grande Irmão, discursando',
    'na véspera, predissera que a frente meridional',
    'indiana continuaria serena mas que seria',
    'lançada em breve uma ofensiva eurasiana',
    'no Norte da áfrica. Entretanto, o Alto',
    'Comando Eurasíano desfechara sua ofensiva',
    'no sul da índia, deixando a áfrica em',
    'paz. Tornava-se portanto necessário reescrever',
    'um parágrafo do discurso do Grande Irmão,',
    'de maneira a fazer com que predissesse exatamente',
    'o que sucedera. Ou ainda, o Times de dezenove',
    'de dezembro publicara as previsões oficiais',
    'da produção de vários artigos de consumo',
    'no quarto trimestre de 1983, correspondente',
    'ao sexto trimestre do Novo Plano Trienal.',
    'O jornal de hoje continha uma notícia sobre',
    'a produção real, pela qual se verificava',
    'que as profecias estavam redondamente erradas.',
    'O serviço de Winston era retificar as cifras',
    'originais, fazendo com que concordassem com',
    'as posteriores. Quanto ao terceiro bilhete',
    'referia-se a simplíssimo erro, que poderia',
    'ser consertado num minuto. Recentemente,',
    'em fevereiro, o Ministério da Fartura dera',
    'a público uma promessa ("penhor categórico"',
    'eram as palavras oficiais) de que não haveria',
    'corte da ração de chocolate em 1984.',
    'Na verdade, como o sabia Winston, a ração',
    'de chocolate deveria ser reduzida de trinta',
    'a vinte gramas no fim da semana. Bastava',
    'portanto substituir a promessa original por',
    'uma advertência de que provavelmente seria',
    'necessário reduzir a ração por volta',
    'de abril. Assim que Winston providenciou',
    'as correções ordenadas, prendeu com um',
    'grampo as correções falascritas aos exemplares',
    'correspondentes do Times e meteu-os no tubo',
    'pneumático. Daí, com um movimento tão',
    'inconsciente quanto possível, amassou o',
    'recado original e as notas que havia feito,',
    'e atirou-as no buraco da memória, para',
    'pasto das chamas. O que sucedia no labirinto',
    'invisível a que levavam os tubos pneumáticos,',
    'ele não sabia em detalhe, mas apenas em',
    'termos gerais. Assim que fossem reunidas',
    'e classificadas todas as correções consideradas',
    'necessárias a um dado número do Times,',
    'aquela edição era reimpressa, destruido',
    'o número original, e o exemplar correto',
    'colocado no arquivo, em seu lugar. êsse',
    'processo de alteração contínua aplicava-se',
    'não apenas a jornais, como também a livros,',
    'publicações periódicas, panfletos,',
    'cartazes, folhetos, filmes, bandas de som,',
    'caricaturas, fotografias, a toda espécie',
    'de literatura ou documentação que pudesse',
    'ter o menor significado político ou ideológico.',
    'Dia a dia e quase minuto a minuto o passado',
    'era atualizado. Desta forma, era possível',
    'demonstrar, com prova documental, a correção',
    'de todas as profecias do Partido; jamais',
    'continuava no arquivo uma notícia, artigo',
    'ou opinião que entrasse em conflito com',
    'as necessidades do momento. Tôda a história',
    'era um palimpsesto, raspado e reescrito tantas',
    'vezes quantas fosse necessário. Em nenhum',
    'caso seria possível, uma vez feita a operação,',
    'provar qualquer fraude. A maior secção',
    'do Departamento de Registro, muito maior',
    'do que a de Winston, consistia simplesmente',
    'de gente que tinha por obrigação procurar',
    'e separar todos os exemplares de livros,',
    'jornais e outros documentos superados e por',
    'isso destinados à eliminação. Continuava',
    'no arquivo, com a data original, uma porção',
    'de Times que talvez, por causa de modificações',
    'do alinhamento político, ou profecias erradas',
    'do Grande Irmão, haviam sido alterados',
    'uma dúzia de vezes, e não havia outros',
    'exemplares que pudessem contradizê-lo.',
    'Os livros também eram recolhidos e reescritos',
    'uma porção de vezes, e invariàvelmente',
    'entregues aos leitores sem admissão alguma',
    'da troca. Nem mesmo as instruções escritas',
    'que Winston recebia, e das quais invariàvelmente',
    'se desfazia assim que as cumpria, ordenavam',
    'ou insinuavam qualquer ato de falsificação:',
    'a referência era sempre a erros, enganos,',
    'equívocos, mal- interpretações que',
    'precisavam ser corrigidos, no interêsse',
    'da exatidão. Na verdade, porém (ele filosofou,',
    'enquanto reajustava as cifras do ministério',
    'da Fartura), não chegava a falsificação.',
    'Era apenas a substituição de uma sandice',
    'por outra. A maior parte do material tratado',
    'não tinha relação alguma com coisas',
    'reais, nem mesmo o tipo da ligação que',
    'se contém numa mentira declarada. As estatisticas',
    'eram tão fantásticas na versão original',
    'como na retificada. Com efeito, era função',
    'do pessoal inventar estatísticas, tirando-as',
    'da própria cachola. Por exemplo, o cálculo',
    'do Ministério da Fartura, prevendo a produção',
    'trimestral de botinas num total de cento',
    'e quarenta e cinco milhões de pares. A',
    'produ ção real, dizia-se, fora de sessenta',
    'e dois milhões. Todavia Winston, ao reescrever',
    'a previsão, reduzira a cifra a apenas cinqüenta',
    'e sete milhões, de modo a poder protestar,',
    'como de hábito, que a cota fora superada.',
    'Em qualquer caso, os sessenta e dois milhões',
    'estavam tão perto da verdade quanto cinqüenta',
    'e sete, ou cento e quarenta e cinco. Com',
    'toda probabilidade, não haviam fabricado',
    'botina alguma. Ou, mais certo ainda, ninguém',
    'tinha a menor idéia de quantos calçados',
    'tinham sido produzidos; nem ninguém se',
    'importava. Tudo o que se sabia é que, cada',
    'trimestre, quantidades astronômicas de',
    'botinas eram produzidas no papel, ao passo',
    'que talvez metade da população da Oceania',
    'andava descalça. E assim era com todos',
    'os fatos registrados, pequenos ou grandes.',
    'Tudo se fundia e confundia num mundo de sombras',
    'no qual, por fim, até a data do ano se',
    'tornara incerta. Winston olhou para o outro',
    'lado do corredor. Num cubículo correspondente',
    'ao seu, um homenzinho de queixo escuro e',
    'cara de precisionista, trabalhava com afinco,',
    'um jornal dobrado sobre os joelhos e a boca',
    'bem junto ao tubo do falascreve. Chamava-se',
    'Tillotson, e parecia querer manter o que',
    'dizia em segrêdo entre ele e a teletela.',
    'Levantou os olhos e seus óculos relampaguearam',
    'uma centelha hostil na direção de Winston.',
    'Winston mal conhecia Tillotson, e não tinha',
    'idéia de qual seria o seu serviço. Os',
    'funcionários do Registro hesitavam em falar',
    'das suas atividades. No longo corredor sem',
    'janelas, com sua dupla fila de cubículos',
    'e o interminável roçar de papéis e',
    'jornais, e a zoeira das vozes murmurando',
    'dentro dos falascreve, havia cerca de uma',
    'dúzia de pessoas que Winston não conhecia',
    'nem de nome, embora as visse andar apressadas',
    'pelo pavimento ou gesticular frenéticas',
    'nos Dois Minutos de ódio. Sabia que no',
    'cubículo ao lado a mulherzinha do cabelo',
    'cor de areia labutava dia após dia, não',
    'fazendo outra coisa senão procurar e suprimir',
    'da imprensa os nomes de pessoas vaporizadas,',
    'e portanto consideradas inexistentes. Era',
    'justo que tivesse êsse emprêgo, pois',
    'seu marido fora vaporizado havia alguns anos.',
    'A alguns cubículos adiante, uma criatura',
    'terna, ineficiente, sonhadora, um homem chamado',
    'ãmpleforth, de orelhas muito peludas e',
    'surpreendente talento para manejar rimas',
    'e metros, empenhava-se na produção de',
    'versões modificadas, textos definitivos,',
    'chamavam-se, de poemas que se haviam tornado',
    'ideológicamente ofensivos mas que, por',
    'um motivo ou outro, tinham de ser conservados',
    'nas antologias. E aquele corredor, com cerca',
    'de cinqüenta funcionários, era apenas',
    'uma subseção, uma simples célula, podia-se',
    'dizer, da enorme complexidade do Departamento',
    'de Registro. Para cima, para baixo, para',
    'os lados, havia outros enxames de servidores',
    'executando uma inimaginável multidão',
    'de tarefas. Havia as enormes oficinas gráficas,',
    'com os seus sub-redatores, seus peritos em',
    'tipografia, e seus estúdios, equipadíssimos',
    'para a falsificação de fotografias. Havia',
    'a seção de teleprogramas com os seus',
    'técnicos, seus produtores, e as equipes',
    'de atores escolhidos especialmente pelo talento',
    'na imitação de vozes. Havia batalhões',
    'de investigadores de referências, cujo',
    'trabalho era apenas organizar listas de livros',
    'e periódicos a recolher. Havia os vastos',
    'depósitos, onde os documentos corrigidos',
    'eram guardados, e os fornos ocultos onde',
    'os originais eram destruidos. E funcionando',
    'anônimamente não se sabia como, nem onde,',
    'ficava o cérebro orientador, que coordenava',
    'todo o trabalho e fixava diretrizes, mandando',
    'conservar êste ou aquele fragmento do passado,',
    'falsificar outro, e eliminar completamente',
    'aquele outro. E o Departamento de Registro,',
    'afinal de contas, não passava de uma pequena',
    'parte do Ministério da Verdade, cuja missão',
    'básica era não reconstruir o passado',
    'mas fornecer aos cidadãos da Oceania jornais,',
    'filmes, livros escolares, programas de teletela,',
    'peças, romances, com todas as informações',
    'concebíveis, instruções ou entretenimento,',
    'desde uma estátua até uma palavra de',
    'ordem, desde um poema lírico até um tratado',
    'de biologia, desde um be-a-bá até um',
    'dicionário de Novilíngua. E o Ministério',
    'tinha que satisfazer não apenas as cOmplexas',
    'necessidades do Partido, como repetir a mesma',
    'operação, em nível inferior, para o',
    'proletariado. Havia toda uma série de departamentos',
    'autônomos que tratavam de literatura, música,',
    'teatro e divertimentos proletários em geral.',
    'Neles eram produzidos jornalecos ordinários',
    'que continham pouca coisa mais que notícias',
    'de esporte, polícia e astrologia, sensacionais',
    'noveletas de cinco centavos, filmes transbordando',
    'de sexo, e cançonetas sentimentais compostas',
    'inteiramente por meios mecânicos numa espécie',
    'de caleidoscópio especial denominado versificador.',
    'Havia até uma sub-seção inteira, a',
    'Pornosec, como a chamavam em Novilíngua',
    '- dedicada à produção da pornografia',
    'mais reles, embalada em envelopes fechados,',
    'e que nenhum membro do Partido, além dos',
    'que nela trabalhavam, tinha licença de',
    'ver. Enquanto Winston trabalhava, três',
    'bilhetes haviam caido do tubo pneumático;',
    'mas eram coisas simples, e ele os liquidou',
    'antes dos Dois Minutos de ódio o interromperem.',
    'Depois de terminado o ódio, voltou ao cubículo,',
    'apanhou o dicionário de Novilíngua da',
    'prateleira, empurrou o falascreve para o',
    'lado, limpou os óculos, e dedicou-se à',
    'tarefa principal da manhã. O trabalho era',
    'o maior prazer na vida de Winston. Em geral,',
    'não passava duma rotina aborrecida, mas',
    'incluía às vezes trabalhos tão difíceis',
    'e intrincados que neles se podia perder como',
    'nas profundidades de um problema matemático',
    '- falsificações delicadas, sem coisa',
    'alguma para servir de orientação, além',
    'do conhecimento dos princípios do Ingsoc',
    'e um cálculo do que o Partido desejava',
    'fosse dito. Winston destacava-se nesse tipo',
    'de trabalho. Em certas ocasiões lhe haviam',
    'confiado até a retificação de artigos',
    'de fundo do Times, escritos inteiramente',
    'em Novilíngua. Desenrolou o bilhete que',
    'pusera de lado antes. Dizia: times 3.12.83',
    'noticia ordemdia gi dupliplusimbom refs impessoas',
    'reescreve compl subsuper prearquivo. Em Anticlíngua',
    '(ou inglês comum) se poderia traduzir:',
    'A notícia da Ordem do Dia do Grande Irmão',
    'no Times de 3 de dezembro de 1983 é extremamente',
    'insatisfatória e faz referência a pessoas',
    'não existentes. Reescreve por completo',
    'e submete a minuta à autoridade superior',
    'antes de arquivar. Wínston leu o artigo',
    'ofensivo. Ao que parece, a Ordein do Dia',
    'do Grande Irmão ocupara-se principalmente',
    'de elogiar a obra de uma organização',
    'conhecida por CCFF, que fornecia cigarros',
    'e outras miudezas aos marinheiros das Fortalezas',
    'Flutuantes. Um certo Camarada Withers, eminente',
    'membro do Partido Interno, merecera menção',
    'especial e até uma condecoração, a',
    'Ordem do Mérito Evidente, Segunda Classe.',
    'Três meses depois a CCFF fora dissolvida',
    'de repente, sem que se explicassem as razões.',
    'Podia-se imaginar que Withers e seus auxiliares',
    'tivessem caido em desgraça, porém nada',
    'transpirara nem na imprensa nem na teletela.',
    'Era de esperar- se, aliás, pois era incomum',
    'que os contraventores políticos fossem',
    'julgados ou mesmo denunciados em público.',
    'Os grandes expurgos, envolvendo milhares',
    'de pessoas, com julgamentos públicos de',
    'traidores e ideocriminosos que confessavam',
    'abjetamente os seus crimes, sendo depois',
    'executados, eram espetáculos especiais,',
    'que não ocorriam senão de dois em dois',
    'anos. O mais comum era as pessoas caídas',
    'na antipatia do Partido sumirem simplesmente,',
    'e nunca mais se ouvir falar delas. Nunca',
    'se tinha a mínima idéia do que lhes sucedera.',
    'Em alguns casos, era até possível que',
    'não tivessem morrido. Sem contar seus pais,',
    'Winston conhecia pessoalmente umas trinta',
    'pessoas que haviam desaparecido. Winston',
    'arranhou o nariz, de leve, com um grampo',
    'de papel. No cubículo do outro lado o Camarada',
    'Tillotson ainda se inclinava furtivo sobre',
    'o falascreve. Levantou a cabeça por um',
    'momento: de novo o lampejo hostil dos óculos.',
    'Winston indagou de si próprio se acaso',
    'o Camarada Tillotson estava fazendo o mesmo',
    'que ele. Era perfeitamente possível. Trabalho',
    'tão delicado não devia nunca ser confiado',
    'a uma só pessoa; por outro lado, entregá-lo',
    'a um comité seria admitir abertamente a',
    'falsificação. O mais provável era que',
    'umas doze pessoas estivessem trabalhando',
    'em versões rivais do que na verdade dissera',
    'o Grande Irmão. Mais tarde, algum cérebro',
    'privilegiado do Partido Interno escolheria',
    'esta ou aquela versão, retocá-la-ia nalguns',
    'pontos e daria início aos complicados processos',
    'de referência cruzada necessários, e',
    'daí a mentira selecionada passaria aos',
    'anais permanentes, tornando-se verdade. Winston',
    'não sabia porque Withers se desgraçara.',
    'Talvez por incompetência ou corrupção.',
    'Talvez o Grande Irmão apenas desejasse',
    'se livrar de um subordinado demasiado Popular.',
    'Ou quem sabe Withers, ou alguém ligado',
    'a ele tivesse sido suspeito de tendencias',
    'heréticas. Ou quiçá -era o mais provável',
    '- a coisa tivesse sucedido apenas porque',
    'Os expurgos e as vaporizações eram parte',
    'necessária da mecânica do govêrno.',
    'A única revelação positiva estava nas',
    'palavras "refs impessoas", que indicavam',
    'que Withers já morrera. Não se devia',
    'imaginar isso, automaticamente, quando as',
    'pessoas eram detidas. As vezes eram postas',
    'em liberdade e assim continuavam um ano ou',
    'dois, antes de executadas. Muito raramente,',
    'pessoas que se acreditavam mortas havia muito',
    'tempo, -reapareciam como fantasmas num julgamento',
    'público, implicavam centenas de outras',
    'com seu testemunho e tornavam a desaparecer,',
    'então para sempre. Withers, todavia, já',
    'era uma impessoa. Não existia; nunca existira.',
    'Winston resolveu que não bastaria inverter',
    'a tendência do discurso do Grande Irmão,',
    'Seria melhor focalizar um assunto completamente',
    'desligado do tema original. Poderia transformar',
    'a oração na denúncia costumeira dos',
    'traidores e ideocriminosos, porém isso',
    'daria um pouco na vista, enquanto que inventar',
    'uma vitória na frente, ou algum triunfo',
    'de superprodução no Nono Plano Trienal,',
    'poderia complicar demais os registros. Era',
    'preciso uma peça de pura fantasia. De repente,',
    'brotou-lhe na mente, sob rnedida, a imagem',
    'de um tal Camarada Ogilvy, recém-falecido',
    'em combate, em circunstâncias heróicas.',
    'Ocasiões havia em que o Grande Irmão',
    'dedicava a sua Ordem do Dia ao tributo de',
    'um humilde membro do Partido, um soldado',
    'raso, cuja vida e morte podiam ser apontadas',
    'como exemplos dignos de ser seguidos. Hoje,',
    'ele homenagearia o Camarada Ogilvy. Bem verdade,',
    'não existira essa pessoa, porém umas',
    'linhas de tipo e um par de fotos falsificadas',
    'logo lhe dariam vida. Winston pensou um momento,',
    'puxou o falascreve para perto e começou',
    'a ditar no estilo familiar do Grande Irmão:',
    'estilo ao mesmo tempo militar e pedante,',
    'e muito fácil de imitar, por causa da abundância',
    'de perguntas retóricas, que ele fazia e',
    'ele próprio respondia ("Que lições',
    'devemos tirar deste fato, camaradas? A lição',
    '- que é também um dos princípios fundamentais',
    'do Ingsoc, de que," etc., etc.). Aos três',
    'anos de idade o Camarada Ogilvy recusava',
    'todos os brinquedos, além dum tambor, uma',
    'sub-metralhadora e um modêlo de helicóptero.',
    'Aos seis anos,, um ano antes do normal,',
    'por especial concessão, matriculara-se',
    'nos Espiões; aos nove já era chefe da',
    'tropa. Aos onze, denunciara o tio à Polícia',
    'do Pensamento, depois de entreouvir uma conversa',
    'que lhe parecera revelar tendencias criminosas.',
    'Aos dezessete tornara-se organizador distrital',
    'da Liga Juvenil Anti-Sexo. Aos dezenove,',
    'desenhara uma granada de mão adotada pelo',
    'Ministério da Paz e que, na sua primeira',
    'experiência, matara numa só explosão',
    'trinta e um prisioneiros eurasianos. Aos',
    'vinte e três perecera em ação. Perseguido',
    'por jatos inimigos ao sobrevoar o oceano',
    'índico com importantes despachos, amarrara',
    'ao corpo como contrapeso a sua metralhadora',
    'e saltara do helicóptero ao mar, com despachos',
    'e tudo, um fim que, segundo o Grande Irmão,',
    'não se podia contemplar sem sentir inveja.',
    'O Grande Irmão acrescentou alguns comentários',
    'sobre a pureza e a unidade de propósito',
    'da vida do Camarada Ogilvy. Era abstinente',
    'total, não fumava, não se entregava a',
    'recreações além de uma hora no ginásio;',
    'fizera voto de celibato, por acreditar que',
    'o casamento e o cuidado da família eram',
    'incompatíveis com a devoção de vinte',
    'e quatro horas ao dever. Não tinha na conversação',
    'outros assuntos além dos princípios do',
    'Ingsoc, e nenhum objetivo na vida exceto',
    'a derrota do inimigo eurasiano e a perseguição',
    'de espiões, sabotadores, ideocriminosos',
    'e traidores em geral. Winston debateu consigo',
    'mesmo se devia ou não conferir ao Camarada',
    'Ogilvy a Ordem do Mérito Evidente; por',
    'fim resolveu- se contra, em vista das desnecessárias',
    'referências cruzadas que envolveria. De',
    'novo tornou a relancear a vista para o rival',
    'no cubículo defronte. Algo parecia dizer-lhe,',
    'com certeza, que Tillotson estava empenhado',
    'no mesmo trabalho que ele. Não havia meio',
    'de saber qual das versões por fim seria',
    'adotada, mas tinha a profunda convicção',
    'de que seria a sua. O Camarada Ogilvy, inexistente',
    'uma hora atrás, era agora um fato. Pareceu-lhe',
    'curioso ter a faculdade de criar homens mortos,',
    'mas não vivos. O Camarada Ogilvy, que jamais',
    'existira no presente, agora existia no passado,',
    'e existia com a mesma autenticidade, e as',
    'mesmas provas, que Carlos Magno ou Júlio',
    'César. 5 Na cantina de baixo pé direito,',
    'metida nas entranhas do solo, arrastava-se',
    'devagarinho a fila do almoço. A sala já',
    'estava atulhada, e o barulho era ensurdecedor.',
    'Da grade do balcão vinha uma nuvem de vapor',
    'de guisado, um cheiro metálico, azedo,',
    'que não chegava a dominar o odor do gin',
    'Vitória. Do outro lado da sala havia um',
    'pequeno bar, um simples nicho na parede,',
    'onde se podia comprar gin a dez centavos',
    'a dose grande., Exatamente quem eu procurava',
    '- disse uma voz atrás de Winston. Voltou-se.',
    'Era o seu amigo Syme, que trabalhava no Departamento',
    'de Pesquisa. "Amigo" talvez não fosse a',
    'palavra correta. Não se tinham mais amigos,',
    'tinham-se camaradas; mas havia alguns camaradas',
    'cuja companhia era mais agradável que outros.',
    'Syme era filólogo, especialista em Novilíngua.',
    'Com efeito, fazia parte da enorme equipe',
    'de peritos empenhada na compilação da',
    'Décima Primeira Edição do dicionário',
    'da Novilíngua. Era um sujeito mirrado,',
    'menor que Winston, de cabelo escuro e olhos',
    'grandes, saltados, que eram ao mesmo tempo',
    'zombeteiros e tristonhos, e que pareciam',
    'examinar atentamemte a face do interlocutor.',
    '- Queria te perguntar se tens uma gilete',
    '- disse ele., Nenhuma!, respondeu Winston,',
    'apressado, como quem se sente culpado. -',
    'Procurei em toda parte. Não existem. Todo',
    'mundo vivia procurando gilete. Na verdade',
    'tinha duas lâminas, que estava escondendo.',
    'Havia meses que faltavam na praça. Em determinado',
    'momento, havia sempre algum artigo necessário',
    'que as lojas do Partido não tinham para',
    'fornecer. As vezes eram botões, outras',
    'linha para serzir meias, outras atacadores',
    'para sapatos; no momento, eram lâminas',
    'de barba. Só podiam ser encontradas, com',
    'um pouco de sorte, numa busca furtiva no',
    'mercado "livre.", Há seis semanas que',
    'uso a mesma lâmina, acrescentou, mentindo.',
    'A fila deu mais um salto à frente. Quando',
    'pararam, ele se voltou e encarou Syme outra',
    'vez. Os dois apanharam bandejas de metal,',
    'engorduradas, de uma pilha na ponta do balcão.',
    '- Foste ver os enforcamentos, a noite passada?',
    '- indagou Syme., Estava trabalhando, disse',
    'Winston, com indiferença., Com certeza',
    'verei no cinema., Pobre substituição',
    '- comentou Syme. Seus olhos galhofeiros examinaram',
    'o rosto de Winston. Pareciam dizer: "Eu te',
    'conheço. Vejo através de ti, sei muito',
    'bem porque não foste ver os prisioneiros',
    'enforcados." Intelectualmente, Syme era venenoso',
    'de tão ortodoxo. Falava com satisfação',
    'e júbilo, muito desagradáveis, de ataques',
    'de helicópteros a aldeias inimigas, julgamento',
    'e confissão de ideocriminosos, execuções',
    'no subsolo do Ministério do Amor. Para',
    'se conversar direito com ele era essencial',
    'afastá-lo dêsses assuntos, enredando-o,',
    'se possível, nas tecnicalidades da Novilíngua,',
    'a respeito do que era interessante e bem',
    'informado. Winston virou a cabeça um pouco',
    'para o lado, para fugir ao exame dos grandes',
    'olhos escuros., Foi um bom enforcamento',
    '- prosseguiu Syme, recordando., Mas creio',
    'que estragam o espetáculo quando, amarram',
    'os pés do cara. Gosto de vê-los esperneando.',
    'Mas acima de tudo, no fim, a língua saltando',
    'da boca, azulzinha, azul brilhante. é',
    'o detalhe que mais me interessa., Outro!',
    '- berrou o prole de avental branco, que empunhava',
    'a concha de sopa. Winston e Syme empurraram',
    'as bandejas por baixo da grade. E cada um',
    'recebeu, em segundos, o almoço regulamentar',
    '- marmita de metal com um guisado rosa-cinza,',
    'um pedaço de pão, um cubo de queijo,',
    'uma xícara de Café Vitória, preto,',
    'uma tablete de sacarina., Vamos para aquela',
    'mesa debaixo da teletela,, disse Syme. -',
    'E no caminho pegamos um gin. O gin foi servido',
    'em xícaras de louça sem asa. Atravessaram',
    'em ziguezague o salão cheio e largaram',
    'as bandejas numa mesa de tampo de metal,',
    'no canto da qual alguém deixara um lago',
    'de cozido, um líquido nojento que parecia',
    'vômito. Winston apanhou -a xícara de',
    'gin, fez uma pausa para ganhar coragem e',
    'enguliu a beberagem de gosto oleoso. Ao limpar',
    'as lágrimas dos olhos, descobriu de repente',
    'que estava com fome. Pôs-se a engulir colheradas',
    'do cozido que, entre outros ingredientes,',
    'tinha cubos de uma massa rosada, esponjosa,',
    'que devia ser úma carne qualquer. Nenhum',
    'dos dois falou enquanto não esvaziaram',
    'as marmitas. Na mesa à esquerda de Winston,',
    'um pouco para trás, alguém falava rápido,',
    'sem parar, uma cantilena áspera que parecia',
    'o grasnar de um pato, e que conseguia romper',
    'o falatório da cantina., Como vai o dicionário?',
    '- perguntou Winston, levantando a voz para',
    'se fazer ouvir., Devagar, respondeu Syme.',
    '- Estou nos adjetivos. é fascinante. O',
    'rosto se lhe iluminara imediatamente com',
    'a menção da Novilíngua. Empurrou a',
    'marmita para o lado, apanhou com a mão',
    'delicada o cubo de queijo, o pedaço de',
    'pão com a outra, e ínclinou-se sobre',
    'a mesa, para poder falar sem gritar., A',
    'Décima Primeira Edição será definitiva',
    '- disse ele., Estamos dando à língua',
    'a sua forma final, a forma que terá quando',
    'ninguém mais falar outra coisa. Quando',
    'tivermos terminado, gente como tu terá',
    'que aprendê-la de novo. Tenho a impressão',
    'de que imaginas que o nosso trabalho consiste',
    'principalmente em inventar novas palavras.',
    'Nada disso! Estamos é destruindo palavras',
    '- às dezenas, às centenas, todos os dias.',
    'Estamos reduzindo a língua à expressão',
    'mais simples. A Décima Primeira Edição',
    'não conterá uma única palavra que possa',
    'se tornar obsoleta antes de 2050. Mordeu',
    'famintamente o pão e enguliu dois bocados.',
    'Depois continuou a falar, com uma espécie',
    'de paixão pedante. O rosto magro e moreno',
    'animara-se, os olhos haviam perdido a expressão',
    'de chacota e tinham-se tornado quase sonhadores.',
    '- é lindo, destruir palavras. Naturalmente,',
    'o maior desperdício é nos verbos e adjetivos,',
    'mas há centenas de substantivos que podem',
    'perfeitamente ser eliminados. Não apenas',
    'os sinônimos; os antônimos também.',
    'Afinal de contas, que justificação existe',
    'para a existência de uma palavra que é',
    'apenas o contrário de outra? Cada palavra',
    'contém em si o contrário. "Bom", por',
    'exemplo. Se temos a palavra "bom," para que',
    'precisamos de "mau"? "Imbom" faz o mesmo',
    'efeito, e melhor, porque é exatamente',
    'oposta, enquanto que mau não é. Ou ainda,',
    'se queres uma palavra mais forte para dizer',
    '"bom", para que dispôr de toda uma série',
    'de vagas e inúteis palavras como "excelente"',
    'e "esplêndido" etc. e tal? "Plusbom" corresponde',
    'à necessidade, ou "dupliplusbom" se queres',
    'algo inda mais forte. Naturalmente, já',
    'usamos essas formas, mas na versão final',
    'da Novilíngua não haverá outras. No',
    'fim, todo o conceito de bondade e maldade',
    'será descrito por seis palavras, ou melhor,',
    'uma única. Não vês que beleza, Winston?',
    'Naturalmente, foi idéia do Grande Irmão,',
    '- acrescentou, à guisa de conclusão.',
    'Uma tênue ansiedade perpassou pelo rosto',
    'de Winston à menção do Grande Irmão.',
    'Isso não obstante, Syme imediatamente percebeu',
    'nele uma certa falta de entusiasmo., Não',
    'aprecias realmente a Novilíngua, Winston',
    '-disse, quase com tristeza., Mesmo quando',
    'escreves em Novilíngua, pensas na antiga.',
    'Tenho lido artigos teus no Times. São bons,',
    'mas são traduções. No teu coração,',
    'havias de preferir a Anticlíngua, com toda',
    'a sua imprecisão e suas inúteis gradações',
    'de sentido. Não percebes a beleza que é',
    'destruir palavras. Sabes que Novilíngua',
    'é o único idioma do mundo cujo vocabulário',
    'se reduz de ano para ano? Winston naturalmente',
    'não sabia. Sorriu, com ar de simpatia (ao',
    'que esperava), não confíando em suas',
    'próprias palavras. Syme mordiscou outro',
    'fragmento do pão escuro, mastigou-o um',
    'pouco e continuou: -Não vês que todo',
    'o objetivo da Novilíngua é estreitar',
    'a gama do pensamento? No fim, tornaremos',
    'a crimidéia literalmente impossível,',
    'porque não haverá palavras para expressá-la.',
    'Todos os conceitos necessários serão',
    'expressos exatamente por uma palavra, de',
    'sentido rigidamente definido, e cada significado',
    'subsidiário eliminado, esquecido. Já,',
    'na Décima Primeira Edição, não estamos',
    'longe disso. Mas o processo continuará',
    'muito tempo depois de estarmos mortos. Cada',
    'ano, menos e menos palavras, e a gama da',
    'consciência sempre um pouco menor. Naturalmente,',
    'mesmo em nosso tempo, não há motivo nem',
    'desculpa para cometer uma crimidéia. é',
    'apenas uma questão de disciplina, controle',
    'da realidade. Mas no futuro não será',
    'preciso nem isso. A Revolução se completará',
    'quando a língua for perfeita. Novilíngua',
    'é Ingsoc e Ingsoc é Novilíngua,, agregou',
    'com uma espécie de satisfação mística.',
    '- Nunca te ocorreu, Winston, que por volta',
    'do ano de 2050, o mais tardar, não viverá',
    'um único ser humano capaz de compreender',
    'esta nossa palestra?, Exceto., começou',
    'Winston, em tom de dúvida, mas parou de',
    'repente. Estivera a pique de dizer "Exceto',
    'os proles", mas controlou- se, sem ter plena',
    'certeza de que essa observação fosse',
    'ortodoxa. Syme, todavia, adivinhara o que',
    'ele quisera dizer., Os proles não são',
    'seres humanos,, disse ele, descuidado. -',
    'Por volta de 2050, ou talvez mais cêdo,',
    'todo verdadeiro conhecimento da Anticlíngua',
    'terá desaparecido. A literatura do passado',
    'terá sido destruida, inteirinha. Chaucer,',
    'Shakespeare, Milton, Byron, só existirão',
    'em versões Novilíngua, não apenas transformados',
    'em algo diferente, como transformados em',
    'obras contraditórias do que eram. Até',
    'a literatura do Partido mudará. Mudarão',
    'as palavras de ordem. Como será possível',
    'dizer "liberdade é escravidão se for',
    'abolido o conceito de liberdade? Todo o mecanismo',
    'do pensamento será diferente. Com efeito,',
    'não haverá pensamento, como hoje o entendemos.',
    'Ortodoxia quer dizer não pensar. não',
    'precisar pensar. Ortodoxia é inconsciência.',
    'Qualquer dia, refletiu Winston, com convicção',
    'profunda e repentina, Syme será vaporizado.',
    'é inteligente demais. Vê demasiado claro',
    'e fala sém subterfúgios. O Partido não',
    'gosta de gente assim. Um dia ele desaparecerá.',
    'Está na cara. Winston liquidara o pão',
    'e queijo. Virou um pouco de lado na cadeira',
    'para beber a xícara de café. Na mesa',
    'à esquerda o homem da voz estridente continuava',
    'falando sem parar, sem dó dos ouvintes.',
    'Uma jovem, talvez su\'a secretária, sentada',
    'de costas para Winston, escutava com atenção',
    'e parecia ansiosa em concordar com tudo quanto',
    'ele dizia, De vez em quando Winston apanhava',
    'uma observação como "Eu acho que tens',
    'tanta razão, concordo tanto contigo," dita',
    'numa voz feminina, juvenil e um tanto tola.',
    'Mas a outra voz não parava por um instante',
    'sequer, nem mesmo quando a moça falava.',
    'Winston conhecia o homem de vista, embora',
    'a seu respeito não soubesse senão que',
    'ocupava cargo importante no Departamento',
    'de Ficção. Teria uns trinta anos, e ostentava',
    'pescoço musculoso, e boca grande, muito',
    'agitada. Como estava com a cabeça um pouco',
    'inclinada para trás, seus óculos captavam',
    'a luz e apresentavam a Winston dois discos',
    'brancos, em vez de olhos. O horrível era',
    'que daquela catadupa de som que borbotava',
    'de sua boca, mal se podia distinguir uma',
    'palavra solta. Apenas uma vez Winston apanhou',
    'uma frase, "eliminação completa e final',
    'do goldsteinismo", grasnada toda de uma',
    'vez, numa peça só, como se fosse uma',
    'linha de linotipo. O resto não passava',
    'de barulho, quá-quá-quá. Embora não',
    'se pudesse ouvir o que o homem dizia, não',
    'podia haver dúvida quanto à natureza',
    'geral da litania. Talvez estivesse denunciando',
    'Goldstein e exigindo medidas mais severas',
    'contra os ideocriminosos e sabotadores, tálvez',
    'fulminando as atrocidades do exército eurasiano;',
    'podia estar louvando Grande Irmão ou os',
    'heróis da frente de Malabar, não fazia',
    'diferença. Fosse o que fosse, podia-se',
    'ter a certeza de que cada palavra era pura',
    'ortodoxia, puro Ingsoc. Olhando a cara sem',
    'olhos, a mandíbula mexendo sem parar, Winston',
    'teve a sensação curiosa de não se tratar',
    'de um legitimo ente humano, mas de uma espécie',
    'de manequim. Não era o cérebro do homem',
    'que falava, era a laringe. O que saía da',
    'boca era constituido de palavras, mas não',
    'era fala genuina: era um barulho inconsciente,',
    'como o grasnido dum pato. Syme calara-se',
    'por um momento, e com o cabo da colher desenhava',
    'arabescos de caldo sobre a mesa. A voz da',
    'outra mesa continuou grasnando rápido,',
    'fácil de ouvir apesar da barulheira ambiente.',
    '- Em Novilíngua há uma palavra que não',
    'sei se conheces. é patofalar, disse Syme.',
    '- Grasnar como pato. é uma dessas palavras',
    'interessantes que têm dois sentidos contraditórios.',
    'Aplicada a um adversário, é insulto;',
    'aplicada a um correligionário, é elogio.',
    'Sem dúvida alguma Syme será vaporizado,',
    'Winston tornou a pensar. Pensou-o com um',
    'laivo de tristeza, embora soubesse muito',
    'bem que Syme o desprezava e hostilizava ligeiramente,',
    'e que era perfeitamente capaz de denunciá-lo',
    'como ideocriminoso se enxergasse algum motivo',
    'para assim Proceder. Havia algo de errado,',
    'de sutilmente errado, em Syme. Carecia de',
    'discreção, indiferença, e de estupidez',
    'salvadora. Não se podia dizer que fosse',
    'ortodoxo. Acreditava nos princípios do',
    'Ingsoc, venerava o Grande Irmão, rejubilava-se',
    'com as vitórias, odiava os hereges, não',
    'apenas com sinceridade como com zêlo incansável',
    'e informação recente, de que os militantes',
    'comuns não se aproximavam. Todavia, um',
    'ligeiro ar de má fama estava sempre presente',
    'nele. Dizia coisas que era melhor calar,',
    'lia livros demais, frequentava o Café Castanheira,',
    'santuário de pintores e músicos. Não',
    'havia lei, nem implícita, contra a freqüência',
    'do Café Castanheira; ainda assim, a casa',
    'era de maus preságios. Os antigos e desacreditados',
    'líderes do Partido costumavam reunirse',
    'lá, antes de serem expurgados. Dizia-se',
    'que o próprio Goldstein fora visto algumas',
    'vezes lá, anos e décadas passadas. Não',
    'era difícil prever o fim de Syme. No entanto',
    'era fato que se Syme percebesse, por três',
    'segundos que fosse, a natureza das opiniões',
    'secretas de Winston, instantâneamente o',
    'denunciaria à Polícia do Pensamento.',
    'Aliás, era o que faria qualquer um: Syme',
    'mais que os outros, porém. O zelo não',
    'bastava. Ortodoxia era inconsciência. Syme',
    'ergueu o olhar., Aí vem Parsons,, anunciou.',
    '- E alguma coisa no seu tom de voz pareceu',
    'acrescentar: "aquele pobre idiota." De fato',
    'Parsons, vizinho de apartamento de Winston',
    'na Mansão Vitória, vinha se encaminhando',
    'para o lado deles, um homenzinho atarracado,',
    'de estatura média, com cabelo claro e cara',
    'de rã. Aos trinta e cinco de idade, já',
    'criava rolos de gordura no pescoço e na',
    'barriga, mas seus movimentos eram alerta',
    'e infantis. Tôda a sua aparência era',
    'a de um menininho crescido, tanto que, embora',
    'usasse o macacão costumeiro, era quase',
    'obrigatório imaginá-lo como um garoto',
    'de calças curtas azuis, camisa cinza e',
    'lenço vermelho dos Espiões. Visualizando',
    'Parsons, via-se sempre uma figura de joelhos',
    'gordos e covinhas, mangas arregaçadas sobre',
    'braços cheios. Com efeito, Parsons invariàvelmente',
    'voltava aos shorts quando uma passeata comunal',
    'ou qualquer outra atividade física lhe',
    'dava pretexto. Cumprimentou-os com um quérulo',
    '"Alô, alô!" e sentou-se à mesa, cheirando',
    'intensamente a suor. Gotinhas de transpiração',
    'brilhavam-lhe no rosto rosado. Era extraordinária',
    'sua capacidade de exsudação. No Centro',
    'Comunal era sempre possível dizer quando',
    'ele estivera jogando pingue- pongue, pela',
    'molhadeira do cabo da raquete. Syme produzira',
    'uma tira de papel na qual havia uma longa',
    'coluna de palavras, e as estudava com um',
    'lápis-tinta na mão., Olha só ele trabalhando',
    'na hora do almôço, disse Parsons, dando',
    'uma cotovelada em Winston., Puxa, hein?',
    'Que é isso aí, velhinho? Vai ver que',
    'é algo difícil para mim. Smith, meu velho,',
    'já te digo porque te procuro. é aquela',
    'conta que te esqueceste de me dar. _. Que',
    'conta é essa?, indagou Winston, procurando',
    'dinheiro automaticamente. Cerca de quarta',
    'parte do salário de cada um tinha de ser',
    'destinada a contribuições voluntárias,',
    'que eram tantas que se tornava difícil',
    'se lembrar de todas., Para a Semana do ódio.',
    'Sabes. coleta domiciliar. Sou o tesoureiro',
    'de nosso quarteirão. Estamos dando uma',
    'virada grande. .. vamos dar um bruto show.',
    'Te digo que não será minha culpa se a',
    'Mansão Vitória não ostentar mais bandeiras',
    'que a rua toda. Me prometeste dois dólares.',
    'Winston achou e entregou duas notas amassadas',
    'e imundas, que Parsons anotou num pequeno',
    'canhenho, com a letrinha caprichada do analfabeto.',
    '-Por falar nisso, meu velho, continuou -',
    'eu soube que o malandrinho do meu garoto',
    'te deu uma estilingada ontem., Passei-lhe',
    'uma boa raspança por causa disso. Sim,',
    'até disse que lhe tomaria o estilingue',
    'se repetisse a proeza., Creio que ficou',
    'um Pouco chateado de não assistir à execução',
    '- disse Winston., Ah, bom. quero dizer,',
    'é o que deve esperar, não? São dois',
    'patifetes, e peraltas, mas tão esforçados!',
    'Só pensam nos Espiões, e na guerra, naturalmente.',
    'Sabes o que a minha filhinha fez sábado',
    'passado, quando a tropa saiu a passeio para',
    'as bandas de Berkhamsted? Convenceu duas',
    'meninas a acompanhá-la, afastou-se do grupo',
    'e passou a tarde toda acompanhando um desconhecido.',
    'Estiveram duas horas no encalço dele, pelos',
    'bosques a fora, e depois, quando chegaram',
    'a Amersham, entregaram-no às patrulhas.',
    '- Por que fizeram isso?, indagou Winston,',
    'um tanto chocado. Parsons continuou, triunfante:',
    '- Minha pirralha convenceu-se de que devia',
    'ser um agente estrangeiro. talvez tivesse',
    'saltado de paraquedas, por exemplo. Mas aqui',
    'é que está o busilis, velho. Sabes o',
    'que a levou a segui-lo? Descobriu que ele',
    'usava uns sapatos muito esquisitos, disse',
    'que antes nunca tinha visto ninguém com',
    'sapatos daqueles. Era portanto provável',
    'que fosse estrangeiro. Bem espertinha para',
    'um espirro de gente, de sete anos, hein?',
    '- Que aconteceu ao homem?, perguntou Winston.',
    '- Ah, isso não sei, naturalmente. Mas não',
    'ficaria nada surpreendido de que., e Parsons',
    'imitou um soldado fazendo mira com o fusil,',
    'e com a língua estalou um tiro., Bom -',
    'fez Syme, distraido, sem nem ao menos levantar',
    'os olhos do papel., Naturalmente, não',
    'podemos nos arriscar, comentou Winston,',
    'lealmente., Quero dizer, estamos em guerra',
    '- disse Parsons. Como se para confirmar essas',
    'palavras, um toque de clarim soou da teletela,',
    'bem por cima da cabeça do trio. Não se',
    'tratava, contudo, da proclamação de uma',
    'vitória militar, mas apenas um anúncio',
    'do Ministério da Fartura., Camaradas!',
    '- gritou uma voz juvenil., Atenção,',
    'camaradas! Temos gloriosas notícias! Ganhamos',
    'a batalha da produção! Os totais completos',
    'da produção de todos os artigos de consumo',
    'demonstram que o padrão de vida aumentou',
    'de nada menos que vinte por cento sobre o',
    'ano passado. Em toda a Oceania houve esta',
    'manhã incontroláveis demonstrações',
    'espontâneas, com os trabalhadores marchando',
    'das fábricas e escritórios, e desfilando',
    'pelas ruas, com estandartes exprimindo sua',
    'gratidão ao Grande Irmão, pela nova vida',
    'feliz que a sua sábia liderança nos deu.',
    'Eis alguns dos totais finais. Gêneros alimentícios.',
    'A expressão "nova vida feliz" correu várias',
    'vezes. últimamente, caira no gôto do',
    'Ministério da Fartura. Parsons, a atenção',
    'presa pelo toque marcial, escutava com ar',
    'solene e boca aberta, mistura de aborrecimento',
    'e enlevo. Não podia acompanhar as cifras,',
    'mas tinha a certeza de que deviam causar',
    'satisfação. Tirara do bolso um cachimbão',
    'imundo, já meio cheio de fumo chamuscado.',
    'Com cem gramas de tabaco por semana, raramente',
    'era possível encher o cachimbo até em',
    'cima. Winston fumava um cigarro Vitória,',
    'que mantinha cuidadosamente na horizontal.',
    'A nova ração só começava no dia seguinte',
    'e lhe restavam apenas quatro cigarros. Conseguira',
    'tapar os ouvidos aos barulhos mais distantes',
    'e estava escutando a parlapatice da teletela.',
    'Aparentemente, houvera até demonstrações',
    'de agradecimento ao Grande Irmão por aumentar',
    'para vinte gramas a ração semanal de',
    'chocolate. No entanto, apenas na véspera,',
    'fora anunciada a redução para vinte gramas.',
    'Seria possível que engulissem aquilo, vinte',
    'e quatro horas depois? Pois enguliam. Parsons',
    'enguliu fàcilmente, com estupidez de animal.',
    'A criatura sem olhos, da outra mesa, enguliu',
    'fanàticamente, apaixonadamente, com um',
    'desejo furioso de descobrir, denunciar e',
    'vaporizar quem quer que ousasse sugerir que',
    'na semana anterior fora trinta gramas. Syme',
    'também, de modo mais complexo, com duplipensar',
    'de permeio, Syme enguliu. Então era ele',
    'o único de posse da lembrança? Fabulosas',
    'estatísticas continuaram saindo da teletela.',
    'Em comparação com o ano anterior havia',
    'mais comida, mais roupa, mais casas, mais',
    'móveis, mais panelas, mais combustível,',
    'mais navios, mais helicópteros, mais livros,',
    'mais recémnascidos, tudo aumentara, exceto',
    'a doença, o crime e a loucura. Ano após',
    'ano, minuto após minuto, todo mundo, tudo,',
    'tudo o mais ganhava as alturas. Como fizera',
    'Syme antes, Winston tomou a colher e com',
    'o caldo se pôs a desenhar calungas sobre',
    'a mesa. Meditava, ressentido, na textura',
    'física da vida. Teria sido sempre assim?',
    'Teria a comida tido sempre o mesmo gôsto?',
    'Olhou em tôrno da cantina. Um salão de',
    'teto baixo, paredes sujas do contacto de',
    'inúmeros corpos; maltratadas cadeiras e',
    'mesas de metal, tão juntinhas que os cotovelos',
    'se tocavam. Colheres arcadas, bandejas trincadas,',
    'rústicas xícaras brancas; gordurentas',
    'todas as superfícies, sujeira em cada frincha;',
    'e um cheiro azedo, composto de gin ordinário,',
    'café ruim, guisado metálico e roupa suja.',
    'Havia sempre, no estômago e na pele, uma',
    'espécie de protesto, a sensação de',
    'que se perdera, para um gatuno, algo a que',
    'se tinha direito. Era fato que não tinha',
    'recordação de nada muito diferente. Em',
    'todas as épocas que lembrava com precisão,',
    'nunca houvera suficiente para comer, nunca',
    'tivera meias ou roupa branca que não fossem',
    'esburacadas, mobília que não fosse capenga',
    'e gasta; e cômodos mal aquecidos, trêns',
    'subterrâneos atulhados, casas caindo aos',
    'pedaços, pão escuro, chá raro, café',
    'nojento, cigarros insuficientes, nada barato',
    'e abundante, exceto gin sintético. E conquanto',
    'as coisas piorassem com o envelhecimento',
    'do corpo, não era isto um sinal de ser',
    'diferente a ordem natural das coisas, quando',
    'o coração se confrangia ante o desconfôrto,',
    'a sujeira e a escassez, os invernos intermináveis,',
    'as meias pegajosas, os elevadores que nunca',
    'funcionavam, a água fria, o sabão áspero,',
    'os cigarros que se desfaziam, a comida de',
    'sabor mau e estranho? Por que achar tudo',
    'isso intolerável, a menos que se tivesse',
    'uma esPécie de lembrança ancestral de',
    'coisas outrora diferentes? Tornou a olhar',
    'em volta da cantina. Quase todo mundo era',
    'feio, e seria feio ainda que se vestisse',
    'direito, em vez de usar o macacão do Partido.',
    'Do outro lado do salão, sózinho numa',
    'mesa, um homem mirrado, que parecia um besouro,',
    'tomava uma xícara de café, os olhinhos',
    'atirando dardos suspicazes para um lado e',
    'outro. Como era fácil, pensou Winston,',
    'acreditar que o tipo físico considerado',
    'ideal pelo Partido, rapazes altos e musculosos,',
    'donzelas de grandes seios, louras, viçosas,',
    'queimadas de sol, alegres, existisse e mesmo',
    'predominasse. Na verdade, até onde podia',
    'julgar, a maioria, na Pista N.o 1, era de',
    'gente miúda, morena, mal favorecida. Era',
    'curioso que aquele tipo de escaravelho proliferasse',
    'nos Ministérios: homenzinhos tronchos,',
    'ainda moços e já obesos, de perninhas',
    'curtas, movimentos rápidos, assustados,',
    'faces gordas e inescrutáveis, de olhos',
    'minúsculos. Era o tipo que parecia florescer',
    'melhor sob o domínio do Partido. O anúncio',
    'do Ministério da Fartura terminou com outra',
    'fanfarra e foi seguido de música metálica.',
    'Parsons, movido a um vago entusiasmo pelo',
    'bombardeio dos números, tirou o cachimbo',
    'da boca., O Ministério da Fartura fez',
    'excelente trabalho êste ano, disse, abanando',
    'a cabeça com ar de quem sabe o que fala.',
    '- Por falar nisso, meu velho Smith, não',
    'tens uma giletinha que possas ceder?, Nenhuma',
    '- replicou Winston., Há seis semanas que',
    'estou usando a mesma lâmina., Ah, bom.',
    'achei que não fazia mal perguntar., Sinto',
    'muito. O grasnido da mesa próxima, provisòriamente',
    'calado pelo aviso do Ministério, recomeçara,',
    'mais forte que nunca. Por algum motivo obscuro',
    'Winston de repente se surpreendeu pensando',
    'na sra. Parsons, com o cabelo ralo e poeira',
    'nas rugas. Dentro de dois anos aquelas crianças',
    'a denunciariam à Polícia do Pensamento.',
    'A sra. Parsons seria vaporizada. Syme seria',
    'vaporizado. Winston seria vaporizado. O\'Brien',
    'seria vaporizado. Por outro lado, Parsons',
    'jamais seria vaporizado. A criatura sem olhos,',
    'da voz grasnante, jamais seria vaporizada.',
    'Os homenzinhos escaravelhais que tão de',
    'manso palmilhavam os labirintos dos Ministérios',
    '- êsses tampouco seriam vaporizados. E',
    'a moça do cabelo escuro, a guria do Departamento',
    'de Ficção: jamais seria vaporizada. Parecia-lhe',
    'saber por instinto quais sobreviveriam e',
    'quais pereceriam, embora não fosse fácil',
    'dizer o que dava direito à sobrevivência.',
    'Naquele momento, foi arrancado das suas meditações',
    'por um violento golpe. A moça da mesa vizinha',
    'voltara-se de lado e estava olhando para',
    'ele. Era a rapariga do cabelo escuro. Olhava-o',
    'com o rabo dos olhos, mas com intensa curiosidade.',
    'No momento em que percebeu que ele também',
    'a fitava, desviou a vista. O suor escorreu',
    'pela espinha de Winston. Um horrível arrepio',
    'de terror perpassou por ele. Sumiu quase',
    'imediatamente, mas deixou um ressaibo de',
    'mal-estar. Por que o fitaria daquele modo?',
    'Por que vivia a segui-lo? Infelizmente, não',
    'podia se lembrar se ela já estava na mesa',
    'quando ele chegara, ou se viera depois. A',
    'questão era que na véspera, durante os',
    'Dois Minutos de ódio, sentara atrás dele',
    'sem haver necessidade visível de o fazer.',
    'Com toda a certeza o seu óbjetivo real',
    'fora escutá-lo e verificar se gritava bem',
    'alto contra Goldstein. O pensamento anterior',
    'voltou à mente de Winston: provavelmente',
    'não era da Polícia do Pensamento, devia',
    'ser o tipo do espião amador, que é a',
    'pior praga de todas. Não sabia quanto tempo',
    'ela o estivera olhando, talvez uns cinco',
    'minutos, e era possível que não tivesse',
    'a fisionomia perfeitamente controlada. Era',
    'terrivelmente perigoso deixar os pensamentos',
    'vaguearem num lugar público, ou no campo',
    'de visão duma teletela. A menor coisa poderia',
    'denunciá-lo. Um tique nervoso, um olhar',
    'inconsciente de ansiedade, o hábito de',
    'falar sózinho, tudo que sugerisse anormalidade,',
    'ou algo de oculto. De qualquer forma, uma',
    'expressão facial imprópria (ar de incredulidade',
    'quando anunciavam uma vitória, por exemplo)',
    'era em si uma infração punível. Em',
    'Novilíngua havia até uma palavra para',
    'caracterizá-la: chamava-se facecrime. A',
    'moça tornara a dar-lhe as costas. Afinal',
    'de contas, talvez não o estivesse seguindo.',
    'Talvez fosse coincidência sentar-se perto',
    'dele dois dias seguidos. Ele depôs cuidadosamente',
    'na beira da mesa o cigarro que se apagara.',
    'Haveria de acabar de fumá-lo depois do',
    'trabalho, se pudesse evitar que o fumo caísse.',
    'Com toda a probabilidade a pessoa da mesa',
    'vizinha era espiã da Polícia do Pensamento,',
    'e ele provavelmente acabaria nos porões',
    'do Ministério do Amor, dali a três dias,',
    'mas uma ponta de cigarro não podia ser',
    'desperdiçada. Syme dobrara o papel em tira',
    'e metera-o no bolso. Parsons pusera-se a',
    'falar de novo., Já te contei, velho -',
    'perguntou, rindo e mordendo o cachimbo -',
    'uma vez que os meus dois pirralhos puseram',
    'fogo na saia duma velha, na feira, porque',
    'a viram embrulhar salsichas num cartaz do',
    'G.I.? De mansinho entraram atrás dela e',
    'puseram fogo no pano com uma caixa de fósforos.',
    'Queimaram-na um pedaço, creio. Safadinhos,',
    'hein? Vivos como azougue! Hoje em dia dão',
    'um treinamento de primeira nos Espiões',
    '-, melhor do que no meu tempo. Que é que',
    'achas, que forneceram aos garotos, agora?',
    'Estetoscópios para escutar pelas fechaduras!',
    'A menina trouxe um para casa a outra noite',
    '- experimentou na porta de nossa sala de',
    'estar, e calculou que podia ouvir o dôbro',
    'do que antes, quando colava a orelha na porta.',
    'Sim, naturalmente não passa dum brinquedo,',
    'mas já vai lhes dando a idéia, não',
    'é? Nesse momento, a teletela soltou um',
    'apito contundente. Era o sinal de volta ao',
    'trabalho. Os três homens se levantaram',
    'num pincho, para correr aos elevadores, e',
    'o fumo restante deslisou do cigarro de Winston.',
    '6 Winston escrevia no diário: Faz três',
    'anos. Era uma noite escura, numa ruela sem',
    'luz, perto duma grande estação ferroviária.',
    'Ela estava parada perto duma porta, sob um',
    'lampeão que mal iluminava o lugar. Tinha',
    'rosto jovem, com pintura espessa. Foi realmente',
    'a pintura que me chamou a atenção, pois',
    'era branca como uma máscara, e os lábios',
    'muito vermelhos, brilhantes. As mulheres',
    'do Partido nunca se pintam. Não havia ninguém',
    'mais na rua, nem teletela. Ela disse dois',
    'dólares e eu. Por um minuto foi difícil',
    'continuar. Fechou os olhos e apertou com',
    'os dedos, tentando afastar a visão que',
    'insistia em voltar. Tinha uma tentação',
    'quase indomável de berrar um bando de palavras',
    'indecentes a pleno pulmão. Ou bater a cabeça',
    'na parede, dar um pontapé na mesa ou atirar',
    'o tinteiro pela janela, fazer algo violento,',
    'doloroso ou ruidoso que pudesse apagar a',
    'lembrança-que o atormentava. Nosso pior',
    'inimigo, refletiu, é o sistema nervoso.',
    'A qualquer momento a tensão que há dentro',
    'da gente pode-se traduzir num sintoma visível.',
    'Pensou num homem com quem cruzara na rua,',
    'havia algumas semanas: um sujeito de aspecto',
    'comum, membro do Partido, de trinta e cinco',
    'ou quarenta anos, alto e magro, levando uma',
    'pasta. Estavam a apenas alguns metros de',
    'distância quando o lado esquerdo do rosto',
    'do homem se contorceu súbitamente num espasmo.',
    'Tornou a acontecer quando cruzaram: era apenas',
    'um tremor, um arrepio, rápido como o clique',
    'do obturador duma máquina fotográfica,',
    'mas evidentemente habitual. Lembrou-se de',
    'ter pensado na ocasião: êsse pobre diabo',
    'está danado. O mais aterrorizante era o',
    'ato talvez ser inconsciente. O pior de todos',
    'os perigos era falar dormindo. Não havia',
    'meio de se proteger contra aquilo. Ele suspirou',
    'e continuou escrevendo: Entrei com ela pela',
    'porta e atravessamos um quintal, chegando',
    'à cozinha dum porão. Contra a parede',
    'havia uma cama, e sobre a mesa uma lâmpada,',
    'muito fraquinha. Ela.. Rílhou os dentes.',
    'Gostaria de cuspir. Ao mesmo tempo que na',
    'mulher da cozinha do porão pensou em Katharine,',
    'sua esposa. Winston era casado, ou fôra',
    'casado; com certeza ainda era casado, pois,',
    'tanto quanto sabia, a espôsa não morrera.',
    'Pareceu inalar de novo o odor morno da cozinha',
    'do porão, um cheiro misto de percevejos,',
    'roupa suja e perfume ordinário, e no entanto',
    'atraente, porque nenhuma mulher do Partido',
    'usava perfume, nem se podia imaginar que',
    'fizesse tal coisa. Só os proles usavam',
    'perfume. Para ele, aquele cheiro trazia à',
    'mente o ato sexual. A escapada com aquela',
    'mulher fora a primeira, em dois anos ou mais.',
    'Andar com prostitutas era proibido, naturalmente,',
    'mas era dessas regras que às vezes os militantes',
    'tinham coragem de quebrar. Era perigoso,',
    'mas não era caso de vida ou morte. Ser',
    'apanhado com uma marafona poderia significar',
    'cinco anos num acampamento de trabalhos forçados;',
    'apenas isso, se não houvesse outra infração.',
    'E era fácil, contanto que se evitasse ser',
    'surpreendido no ato. Os bairros pobres pululavam',
    'de mulheres prontas a se entregarem. Algumas',
    'podiam ser compradas até por uma garrafa',
    'de gin, que os proles não tinham direito',
    'de beber. Tàcitamente, o Partido se inclinava',
    'até a incentivar a prostituição, para',
    'dar saída a instintos que não podiam',
    'ser totalmente suprimidos. Mera luxúria',
    'não tinha maior importância, contanto',
    'que fosse furtiva e sem alegria, e só envolvesse',
    'mulheres de uma classe submersa e desprezada.',
    'O crime imperdoável era a promiscuidade',
    'entre membros do Partido. Mas, embora êste',
    'crime fosse invariàvelmente confessado',
    'pelos acusados, nos grandes expurgos, era',
    'difícil imaginar que acontecesse. O objetivo',
    'do Partido- não era simplesmente impedir',
    'que homens e mulheres criassem lealdades',
    'difíceis de controlar. Seu propósito',
    'real, não declarado, era roubar todo o',
    'prazer ao ato sexual. Não tanto o amor',
    'como o erotismo era o inimigo, tanto dentro',
    'como fora do casamento. Todos os casamentos',
    'entre membros do Partido tinham de ser aprovados',
    'por um comité nomeado para êsse fim e',
    '- embora o princípio jamais fosse claramente',
    'declarado, a permissão era sempre recusada',
    'se o casal desse a impressão de haver qualquer',
    'atração física. O único fim reconhecido',
    'do casamento era procriar filhos para o serviço',
    'do Partido. A cópula devia ser considerada',
    'uma pequena operação ligeiramente repugnante,',
    'como um clister. Isto tampouco era dito em',
    'voz alta, mas de modo indireto era ensinado',
    'a cada membro do Partido, desde a infância.',
    'Havia até organizações como a Liga',
    'Juvenil Anti- Sexo, que advogava completo',
    'celibato para ambos os sexos. Tôdas as',
    'crianças deveriam nascer por inseminação',
    'artificial (insemart) e educadas em instituições',
    'públicas. Isto, Winston sabia, não era',
    'para se levar de todo a sério, mas de certo',
    'modo se encaixava na ideologia geral do Partido.',
    'O Partido estava procurando matar o instinto',
    'sexual, ou, se não fosse possível matá-lo,',
    'torcê-lo e torná-lo indecente. Ele não',
    'sabia o porque dessa conduta, mas assim era,',
    'e lhe parecia natural que assim fosse. E,',
    'no que se referia às mulheres, os esforços',
    'do Partido haviam logrado considerável',
    'êxito. Ele tornou a pensar em Katharine.',
    'Devia fazer nove, dez, quase onze anos que',
    'se haviam separado. Era curioso que pensasse',
    'nela tão raramente. às vezes, passava',
    'dias e dias sem se lembrar de que fora casado.',
    'Tinham vivido juntos apenas quinze meses.',
    'O Partido não permitia o divórcio, mas',
    'até incentivava a separação quando',
    'não havia filhos. Katharine era uma moça',
    'alta, de cabelos claros, muito erecta, de',
    'esplêndidos movimentos. Tinha rosto ousado,',
    'aquilino, que se poderia chamar nobre até',
    'se descobrir não haver Pràticamente nada',
    'por trás dele. Logo no comêço da vida',
    'conjugal descobrira que Katharine possuía,',
    'sem exceção, a mente mais estúpida,',
    'vulgar e vazia que já conhecera, embora',
    'fosse talvez por conhecê-la mais intimamente',
    'que à maioria das pessoas. Não tinha',
    'na cabeça um pensamento que não fosse',
    'uma palavra de ordem, e não havia imbecilidade,',
    'absolutamente nenhuma, que ela não engulisse',
    'se o Partido a impingisse. Dera-lhe, para',
    'uso interno, o apelido de "banda sonora humana".',
    'Todavia, aguentaria viver com ela se não',
    'fosse uma coisa, sexo. Assim que a tocava,',
    'a esposa parecia se encolher e enrijar. Abraçá-la',
    'era o mesmo que cingir uma imagem de madeira',
    'articulada. E o estranho era que, mesmo quando',
    'ela o apertava contra o seu corpo, ele tinha',
    'a impressão de que o repelia com todas',
    'as suas fôrças. Era a rigidez dos seus',
    'músculos que dava aquela impressão. Deixava-se',
    'ficar de olhos fechados, sem resistir nem',
    'cooperar, apenas- se submetendo. Embaraçava',
    'extraordinàriamente, e tornava-se horrível',
    'depois de algum tempo. Entretanto, ele suportaria',
    'viver com ela, se pudessem combinar manter',
    'o celibato Mas foi a própria Katharine',
    'quem recusou êsse arranjo. Dísse que',
    'deviam produzir um filho, se possível.',
    'De modo que o exercício continuou a ter',
    'lugar, uma vez por semana, regularmente,',
    'sempre que não fosse impossível. Ela',
    'chegava a lembrá-lo pela manhã, como',
    'uma tarefa que deve ser feita à noite e',
    'que não pode ser esquecida. Referia-se',
    'ao ato com duas expressões. Uma era "fazer',
    'um filho," e a outra era "nosso dever ante',
    'o Partido" (sim, palavras textuais). Muito',
    'breve ele adquiriu verdadeiro horror da aproximação',
    'do dia convencionado. Por sorte, não houve',
    'filho, e por fim ela concordou em suspender',
    'as experiências. Pouco depois, separaram-se.',
    'Winston suspirou alto. Tornou a apanhar a',
    'caneta e escreveu: Ela atirou-se na cama,',
    'e imediatamente, sem qualquer preliminar,',
    'da maneira mais grosseira e horrível que',
    'se pode imaginar, levantei-lhe a saia. Eu..',
    '.Tornou a ver-se, à luz débil do abajur,',
    'as narinas cheias do odor de percevejo e',
    'perfume barato, e no coração uma sensação',
    'de derrota e ressentimento que, mesmo naquele',
    'momento, vinha de cambulhada com a recordação',
    'do corpo branco de Katharine, congelado para',
    'sempre pelo poder hipnótico do Partido.',
    'Por que teria de ser sempre assim? Por que',
    'não poderia ter uma mulher própria, em',
    'vez de recorrer a essas aventuras sórdidas,',
    'com intervalos de vários anos? Um amor',
    'genuíno, porém, era quase impossível',
    'de imaginar. Tôdas as mulheres do Partido',
    'eram iguais. Nelas a castidade era tão',
    'profunda quanto a lealdade ao Partido. Por',
    'meio de cuidadoso condicionamento, em tenra',
    'idade, por meio de jogos e água fria, pelo',
    'lixo que lhes impingiam na escola, nos Espiões',
    'e na Liga Juvenil, por meio de conferências,',
    'paradas, canções, lemas e música marcial,',
    'tinham expulso o sentimento natural. A razão',
    'dizia-lhe que devia haver exceções, mas',
    'no fundo do coração não acreditava',
    'nisso. Eram todas inexpugnáveis, como desejava',
    'o Partido. E o que ele queria, mais do que',
    'ser amado, era deitar abaixo aquela muralha',
    'de virtude, mesmo que fosse apenas uma vez',
    'na vida inteira. Executado com êxito, o',
    'ato sexual era rebelião. O desejo era crimidéia.',
    'Despertar o instinto de Katharine, se o tivesse',
    'conseguido, seria como que seduzi-la, embora',
    'fosse sua esposa. Mas era preciso escrever',
    'o resto da história. E ele escreveu: Levantei',
    'o abajur. Quando a vi sob a luz. Depois',
    'da treva, a luzinha fraca do candieiro de',
    'querosene lhe parecera muito clara. Pela',
    'primeira vez, pôde ver a mulher direito.',
    'Dera um passo para ela e se detivera, cheio',
    'de luxúria e terror. Tinha dolorosa consciência',
    'do risco que corria entrando ali. Era perfeitamente',
    'possivel que as patrulhas o apanhassem na',
    'saída: podiam até estar esperando na',
    'porta, naquele momento. E se ele fosse embora',
    'sem realizar o que fora fazer! Era preciso',
    'escrevê-lo, era preciso confessá-lo.',
    'O que vira de repente, sob a luz da lâmpada,',
    'era que se tratava duma velha. A pintura',
    'do rosto era tão grossa que dava a impressão',
    'de que ia rachar como uma máscara de cartão.',
    'Havia fios brancos no cabelo; mas o detalhe',
    'verdadeiramente revoltante era a boca, que',
    'se entreabria, revelando nada mais que uma',
    'caverna negra. A mulher não tinha dente',
    'algum. Ele escreveu com pressa, aos garranchos:',
    'Quando a vi sob a luz, percebi que se tratava',
    'duma velha, de uns cinqüenta anos pelo',
    'menos. Mas fui em frente e fiz o que fora',
    'fazer. Tornou a apertar as pálpebras com',
    'os dedos. Escrevera tudo, por fim, mas não',
    'fazia diferença. A terapia não dera resultado.',
    'Continuava, mais forte que nunca, o desejo',
    'de berrar obscenidades a plenos pulmões.',
    '7 Se há esperança, escreveu Winston,',
    'está nos proles. Se esperança houvesse,',
    'devia estar nos proles, porque só neles,',
    'naquela massa desdenhada, formigante, 85%',
    'da população da Oceania, podia se gerar',
    'fôrça suficiente para destruir o Partido.',
    'O Partido não poderia ser derribado de',
    'dentro. Seus inimigos, se é que tinha inimigos,',
    'não tinham modo de se reunir, nem mesmo',
    'de se identificar. Mesmo que existisse a',
    'legendária Fraternidade, como era possível',
    'que existisse, era inconcebível que os',
    'seus membros pudessem jamais se reunir em',
    'grupos maiores que dois ou três. A rebelião',
    'revelava-se num olhar, numa inflexão da',
    'voz; no máximo, num cochicho ocasional.',
    'Mas os proles, se de algum modo adquirissem',
    'consciência do seu poderio, não precisariam',
    'conspirar. Bastava-lhes levantarem-se e sacudirse,',
    'como um cavalo sacode as moscas. Se o quisessem,',
    'poderiam demolir o Partido no dia seguinte.',
    'Mais cedo ou mais tarde, isso lhes haveria',
    'de ocorrer. No entanto. ! Lembrou-se de',
    'uma vez em que ia passando por uma rua cheia',
    'de gente quando um tremendo grito de centenas',
    'de vozes, vozes de mulher, se fizera ouvir',
    'num beco lateral, pouco adiante. Era um formidável',
    'brado de ira e desespêro, um "Oh-o-o-o-oh!"',
    'forte e grave, que continuou como a reverberação',
    'de um sino. Seu coração dera um pinote.',
    'Começou! pensara. Um conflito! Por fim',
    'os proles se libertam! Quando chegou ao local,',
    'viu um bando de duzentas ou trezentas mulheres,',
    'cercando as barracas de uma feira, faces',
    'trágicas como se fossem passageiros condenados',
    'num navio a soçobrar. Naquele momento exato,',
    'porém, o desespêro geral se subdividiu',
    'numa multidão de briguinhas. Ao que parece',
    'uma das barracas tinha caçarolas estanhadas',
    'à venda. Eram de folha fina, horrorosas,',
    'mas era dificílimo arranjar panelas. O',
    'estoque não durara muito, portanto. As',
    'mulheres que tinham conseguido comprar tentavam',
    'se afastar com as caçarolas em punho, pisadas',
    'e acotoveladas pelo resto, enquanto dúzias',
    'de outras clamavam, em tôrno da barraca,',
    'acusando o feirante de favoritismo e de ter',
    'mais caçarolas escondidas. Houve nova série',
    'de uivos. Duas mulheres gordalhufas, uma',
    'delas com o cabelo caindo sobre os olhos,',
    'tinham agarrado a mesma caçarola e estavam',
    'tentando se apossar dela. Por um momento,',
    'houve empate. Depois o cabo se desprendeu.',
    'Winston observou-as enojado. E no entanto,',
    'por um momento, que poderio aterrorizante',
    'se fizera ouvir naquele grito de algumas',
    'centenas de gargantas! Por que não poderiam',
    'gritar dessa forma quando acontecesse algo',
    'de fato importante? Escreveu: Não se revoltarão',
    'enquanto não se tornarem conscientes, e',
    'não se tornarão conscientes enquanto',
    'não se rebelarem. Refletiu que a frase',
    'poderia ser quase a transposição de um',
    'dos textos básicos do Partido. O Partido',
    'proclamava, naturalmente, ter libertado os',
    'proles da servidão. Antes da Revolução',
    'eram oprimidos pelos capitalistas, tinham',
    'sido chicoteados e submetidos à fome, as',
    'mulheres forçadas a trabalhar nas minas',
    'de carvão (na verdade, as mulheres ainda',
    'trabalhavam nas minas), as crianças vendidas',
    'às fábricas com a idade de seis anos.',
    'Simultâneamente, fiel aos princípios',
    'do duplipensar, o Partido ensinara que os',
    'proles eram naturalmente inferiores, que',
    'deviam ficar em sujeição, como animais,',
    'pela aplicação de algumas regras simples.',
    'Pouquíssimo se sabia a respeito dos proles.',
    'Não era necessário saber muito. Contanto',
    'que continuassem a trabalhar e se reproduzir,',
    'não tinham importância suas outras atividades.',
    'Abandonados a si mesmos, como gado solto',
    'nas planuras argentinas, haviam regressado',
    'a um modo de vida que lhes parecia natural,',
    'uma espécie de tradição ancestral.',
    'Nasciam, cresciam nas sargetas, iam para',
    'o trabalho aos doze, atravessavam um breve',
    'período de floração da beleza e do',
    'desejo sexual, casavam-se aos vinte, atingiam',
    'a maturidade aos trinta, e em geral morriam',
    'aos sessenta. O trabalho físico pesado,',
    'o trato da casa e dos filhos, as briguinhas',
    'com a vizinhança, o cinema, o futebol,',
    'a cerveja e, acima de tudo, o jôgo, enchiam-lhes',
    'os horizontes. Mantê-los sob contrôle',
    'não era difícil. Alguns agentes da Polícia',
    'do Pensamento estavam sempre entre eles,',
    'soltando boatos, marcando e eliminando os',
    'poucos individuos julgados capazes de se',
    'tornar perigosos; mas não se tentava doutriná-los',
    'com a ideologia do partido. Não era desejável',
    'que os proles tivessem sentimentos políticos',
    'definidos. Tudo que se lhes exigia era uma',
    'espécie de patriotismo primitivo ao qual',
    'se podia apelar sempre que fosse necessário',
    'levá-los a aceitar rações menores ou',
    'maior expediente de trabalho. E mesmo quando',
    'ficavam descontentes, como às vezes acontecia,',
    'o descontentamento não os conduzia a parte',
    'alguma porque, não tendo idéias gerais,',
    'só podiam focalizar a animosidade em ridículas',
    'reivindicações específicas. Os males',
    'maiores geralmente lhes fugiam à observação.',
    'A grande maioria dos proles nem tinha teletelas',
    'em casa. Até a polícia civil interferia',
    'pouquíssimo com eles. Havia enorme criminalidade',
    'em Londres! todo um mundo subterrâneo de',
    'ladrões, bandidos, prostitutas, vendedores',
    'de narcóticos e contraventores de todo',
    'tipo; mas como tudo se passava entre os próprios',
    'proles, não tinha importância. Em todas',
    'as questões morais, permitia-se-lhes obedecerem',
    'ao código ancestral. O puritanismo sexual',
    'do Partido não lhes era imposto. A promiscuidade',
    'não era punida, e o divórcio era permitido.',
    'Nesse particular, até a adoração religiosa',
    'teria sido permitida se os proles demonstrassem',
    'algum sintoma de desejá-la ou dela carecerem.',
    'Ninguém desconfiava deles. Como dizia o',
    'lema do Partido: "Os proles e os animais',
    'são livres." Winston esticou o braço',
    'e coçou cautelosamente a variz ulcerada.',
    'Começara a comichar de novo. O que sobrevinha',
    'invariàvelmente era a impossibilidade de',
    'saber como de fato fora a vida antes da Revolução.',
    'Tirou da gaveta um livro escolar de história,',
    'que tomara emprestado à sra. Parsons, e',
    'pôs-se a copiar um trecho no diário:',
    'Antigamente (dizia), antes da gloriosa Revolução,',
    'Londres não era a bela cidade que hoje',
    'conhecemos. Era um lugar escuro, sujo, miserável,',
    'onde pouca gente tinha bastante que comer',
    'e onde centenas e milhares de pobres não',
    'tinham calçado nem abrigo onde dormir.',
    'Crianças de mais ou menos a tua idade tinham',
    'de trabalhar doze horas por dia, para patrões',
    'cruéis, que as castigavam com chicotes',
    'quando trabalhavam muito devagar e não',
    'lhes davam senão côdeas de pão velho',
    'e água. Mas no meio dessa terrível pobreza',
    'havia umas poucas casas belíssimas habitadas',
    'pelos ricos, que tinham até trinta criados',
    'para cuidar deles. êsses homens ricos chamavam-se',
    'capitalistas. Eram gordos, feios, de caras',
    'perversas, como a que vês na página ao',
    'lado. Repara que veste um grande casaco negro,',
    'chamado fraque, e um chapéu estranho, brilhante,',
    'como uma chaminé truncada, e que se chamava',
    'cartola. Era êsse o uniforme dos capitalistas',
    'e ninguém mais podia usá-lo. Os capitalistas',
    'eram donos de tudo no mundo, e todas as outras',
    'pessoas eram escravas deles. Eram donos de',
    'toda a terra, todas as casas, todas as fábricas,',
    'todo o dinheiro. Se alguém lhes desobedecesse,',
    'podiam jogá-lo na prisão, ou podiam tomar-lhe',
    'o emprego e matá-lo lentamente, pela fome.',
    'Quando um cidadão comum falava com um capitalista,',
    'tinha de se encolher e se inclinar, tirar',
    'o boné e chamá-lo de "Senhor." O chefe',
    'de todos os capitalistas denominava-se Rei,',
    'e. Mas ele conhecia o resto do catálogo.',
    'Vinhàm as referências aos bispos com',
    'suas vestes opulentas, os juizes e os mantos',
    'de arminho, o pelourinho, o cepo, a roda',
    'de castigo, o gato de nove caudas, o Banquete',
    'do Lord Maior e a prática de beijar o artelho',
    'do Papa. Haveria também o chamado jus primae',
    'noctis, que provavelmente não seria citado',
    'num livro para crianças. Era o direito',
    'de todo capitalista de dormir com qualquer',
    'operária de suas fábricas. Como era possível',
    'dizer onde acabava a verdade e começava',
    'a mentira? Podia ser verdade que o ser humano',
    'comum agora vivesse melhor do que antes da',
    'Revolução. A única prova em contrário',
    'era o protesto mudo nos ossos, o sentimento',
    'instintivo de que as condições em que',
    'vivia eram intoleráveis e que deviam ter',
    'sido diferentes. De repente achou que as',
    'únicas coisas verdadeiramente típicas',
    'da vida moderna não eram nem a crueldade',
    'nem a insegurança, mas apenas a nudez,',
    'a miséria, o desânimo. Olhando-se em',
    'tôrno, verificava-se que a vida não apenas',
    'diferia das mentíras que Provinham das',
    'teletelas, como também dos ideais que o',
    'Partido buscava atingir. Muitas atividades',
    'cotidianas, mesmo para um membro do Partido,',
    'eram neutras e não políticas, questão',
    'de cumprir tarefas tediosas, lutar por um',
    'lugar no trem subterrâneo, remendar uma',
    'meia gasta, esmolar uma pastilha de sacarina,',
    'guardar uma ponta de cigarro. O ideal criado',
    'pelo Partido era enorme, terrível, luzidio',
    '- um mundo de aço e concreto, de monstruosas',
    'máquinas e armas aterrorizantes, uma nação',
    'de guerreiros e fanáticos, marchando avante',
    'em perfeita unidade, todos tendo os mesmos',
    'pensamentos e gritando as mesmas divisas',
    '- trezentos milhões comm a mesma cara -',
    'trabalhando perpètuamente, lutando, triunfando,',
    'perseguindo. A realidade eram cidades caindo',
    'em ruinas, escuras, onde o populacho subnutrido',
    'perambulava com sapatos furados, vivendo',
    'em remendadas casas do século dezenove',
    'que sempre cheiravam a repolho e latrinas',
    'de mau funcionamento. Parecia ter uma visão',
    'de Londres, vasta e arruinada, uma cidade',
    'de um milhão de latas de lixo, e misturada',
    'com ela a figura da sra. Parsons, mulher',
    'de cara enrugada e cabelo ralo, lidando sem',
    'esperança com um cano de esgôto. Tornou',
    'a esticar o braço e a coçar o tornozelo.',
    'Dia e noite as teletelas feriam os ouvidos',
    'com estatísticas provando que hoje o povo',
    'tinha mais alimento, mais roupa, melhores',
    'casas, melhor divertimento, que vivia mais,',
    'trabalhava menos, era mais alto, mais saudável,',
    'mais forte, mais feliz, mais inteligente,',
    'mais bem educado, do que o povo de cinqüenta',
    'anos atrás. Nenhuma palavra podia ser provada',
    'ou negada. O Partido proclamava, por exemplo,',
    'que hoje 40% dos proles eram alfabetizados;',
    'e dizia que antes da Revolução o total',
    'não chegava a 15%. O Partido afirmava que',
    'a mortalidade infantil era agora de apenas',
    '160 por mil, enquanto que antes fora trezentos',
    'por mil, e assim por diante. Era uma equação',
    'única com duas incógnitas. Podia muito',
    'bem dar-se que cada palavra, literalmente,',
    'dos livros de história, mesmo quando aceite',
    'sem dúvida, fosse pura fantasia. Tanto',
    'quanto sabia, podia muito bem ser que nunca',
    'tivesse havido o jus primae noctis, nem capitalistas,',
    'nem cartola. Tudo se fundia na névoa. O',
    'passado era raspado, esquecida a raspagem,',
    'e a mentira tornava-se verdade. Apenas uma',
    'vez na vida possuira, depois do acontecimento:',
    'era o que importava, prova concreta, inegável',
    'de uma falsificação. Tivera-a entre os',
    'dedos durante uns trinta segundos. Devia',
    'ter sido em 1973, isto é, mais ou menos',
    'na ocasião em que se havia separado de',
    'Katharine. O acontecimento, porém, tivera',
    'lugar sete ou oito anos antes. Com efeito,',
    'a história começara por volta de 1965,',
    'o período dos grandes expurgos em que os',
    'chefes originais da Revolução tinham',
    'sido liquidados duma vez por todas. Aí',
    'por 1970 não sobrava ninguém, exceto',
    'o Grande Irmão. A essa altura todos os',
    'restantes haviam sido acusados de traição',
    'e atividades contra-revolucionárias. Goldstein',
    'fugira e escondera-se em lugar não sabido,',
    'e dos outros alguns tinham desaparecido,',
    'enquanto que a maioria fora justiçada,',
    'após espetaculares julgamentos públicos',
    'em que confessara amplamente seus crimes.',
    'Entre os últimos sobreviventes, contavam-se',
    'três homens chamados Jones, Aaronson e',
    'Rutherford. O trio devia ter sido preso em',
    '1965. Como acontecia com freqüência,',
    'tinham sumido durante um ano ou mais, de',
    'modo que ninguém sabia se estavam vivos',
    'ou mortos; de repente tinham aparecido para',
    'se incriminar da maneira habitual. Confessaram',
    'entendimentos com o inimigo (que naquela',
    'data era a Eurásia), desfalque de dinheiros',
    'públicos, assassínios de vários dignos',
    'membros do Partido, intrigas contra a liderança',
    'do Grande Irmão que se tinham iniciado',
    'muito antes da Revolução, e atos de sabotagem',
    'causadores da morte de centenas de milhares',
    'de inocentes. Depois de confessar, tinham',
    'sido perdoados, reestabelecidos no Partido',
    'e nomeados para cargos que pareciam importantes',
    'mas que não passavam de sinecuras. Os três',
    'haviam escrito longos e abjetos artigos no',
    'Times, analisando as razões da sua defecção',
    'e prometendo emendar-se. Algum tempo depois,',
    'Winston vira os três no Café Castanheira.',
    'Lembrava-se do fascínio com que os examinara,',
    'com o rabo dos olhos. Eram bem mais velhos',
    'que ele, relíquias de um mundo antigo,',
    'quase que as últimas grandes figuras remanescentes',
    'do passado heróico do Partido. O encanto',
    'da luta clandestina e da guerra civil ainda',
    'pairava ligeiramente sobre eles. Winston',
    'teve a impressão, embora já os fatos',
    'e datas se fossem confundindo, que lhes soubera',
    'os nomes muito antes de conhecer o do Grande',
    'Irmão. Mas eram também fora-da-lei, inimigos,',
    'intocáveis, condenados à extinção',
    'com absoluta certeza, dali a um ano ou dois.',
    'Ninguém que tivesse caido uma vez em mãos',
    'da Polícia do Pensamento conseguia escapar.',
    'Eram cadáveres esperando que os devolvessem',
    'ao sepulcro. Não havia ninguém nas mesas',
    'próximas. Não era prudente ser visto',
    'nas proximidades dos três. Estavam sentados,',
    'mudos, diante de copos de gin com cravo que',
    'era a especialidade do café. Dos três,',
    'o que mais impressionara Winston pela aparência',
    'fora Rutherford. Havia sido um famoso caricaturista,',
    'e seus desenhos brutais tinham concorrido',
    'para inflamar a opinião pública antes',
    'e durante a RevOlução. Mesmo agora, a',
    'longos intervalos, suas caricaturas apareciam',
    'no Times. Eram simplesmente uma imitação',
    'do antigo estilo, e curiosamente inertes,',
    'sem convicção. Eram sempre um recozido',
    'de antigos temas, cortiços, crianças',
    'esfomeadas, batalhas de rua, capitalistas',
    'de cartola (até nas barricadas os capitalistas',
    'pareciam conservar as cartolas), um esfôrço',
    'infindo, frouxo, de voltar ao passado. Era',
    'um homem monstruoso, com uma juba de cabelo',
    'grisalho e gorduroso, rosto inchado e cortado',
    'de cicatrizes, grossos lábios negróides.',
    'Devia ter sido imensamente forte; agora o',
    'corpanzil era apenas balofo, mole, caído,',
    'banhas sobrando em todas as direções.',
    'Parecia ruir diante dos olhos dos circunstantes,',
    'como alui uma montanha. Eram quinze horas,',
    'hora solitáría. Winston já não conseguia',
    'lembrar-se do que fora fazer no café àquela',
    'hora. Estava quase deserto. Das teletelas',
    'se desprendia uma música de latas. Os três',
    'estavam sentados no seu canto, sem falar,',
    'quase imóveis. Sem que lhe pedissem, o',
    'garçon trazia novos copos de gin. Na mesa,',
    'ao lado deles havia um tabuleiro de xadrez,',
    'com as peças arrumadas, mas o jôgo não',
    'começara. E então, durante talvez meio',
    'minuto, algo sucedeu às teletelas. A música',
    'que tocavam mudou,\' como também mudou o',
    'tom. Ouviu- se. era algo muito difícil',
    'de descrever. Uma nota peculiar, partida,',
    'um zurro, uma chacota, que Winston, para',
    'seu uso pessoal, considerou amarela. E da',
    'tela uma voz cantou: Sob a frondosa castanheira',
    'Eu te vendi e tu me vendeste: Lá estão',
    'eles, e aqui estamos nós, Sob a frondosa',
    'castanheira. Os homens nem se mexeram. Mas',
    'quando Winston tornou a fitar o rosto arruinado',
    'de Rutherford, notou que tinha os olhos rasos',
    'dágua. E pela primeira vez observou, com',
    'uma espécie de arrepio por dentro, sem',
    'que no entanto soubesse o que lhe dava arrepios,',
    'que tanto Aaronson como Rutherford tinham',
    'nariz quebrado. Pouco depois os três tinham',
    'sido presos de novo. Ao que parece, haviam-se',
    'metido em novas conspirações no mesmo',
    'momento em que tinham ganho a liberdade.',
    'No segundo julgamento, confessaram de novo',
    'todos os velhos crimes acrescentando uma',
    'porção de outros. Foram executados e',
    'sua sina registrada nas histórias do Partido,',
    'como advertência à posteridade. Cerca',
    'de cinco anos depois, em 1973, Winston desenrolava',
    'um maço de documentos que acabava de cair',
    'do tubo pneumático quando deu com um fragmento',
    'de papel que evidentemente fora colocado',
    'entre os outros e esquecido. No instante',
    'em que o desenrolou percebeu-lhe o valor.',
    'Era meia página arrancada do Times de uns',
    'dez anos antes, a parte superior, e incluia',
    'a data, e continha uma foto dos delegados',
    'numa função do Partido em Nova York.',
    'No meio-do grupo destacavam-se Jones, Aaronson',
    'e Rutherford. Impossível confundi-los;',
    'ademais, seus nomes constavam da legenda.',
    'Isso não obstante, os homens tinham confessado,',
    'em ambos os julgamentos, que naquela data',
    'tinham estado em sólo eurasiano. Tinham',
    'voado de um aeroporto secreto no Canadá',
    'a um ponto da Sibéria, onde conferenciaram',
    'com membros do Estado Maior Eurasiano, a',
    'quem haviam traido importantes segredos militares.',
    'A data gravara-se na mente de Winston porque',
    'era o dia do equinócio do verão; mas',
    'a históría toda deveria estar registada',
    'numa porção de outros lugares. Só havia',
    'uma conclusão possível: as confissões',
    'eram falsas. Naturalmente, isto em si não',
    'era nenhum descobrimento. Nem Winston imaginara',
    'que as pessoas suprimidas nos expurgos houvessem',
    'de fato cometido os crimes de que eram acusadas.',
    'Mas ali estava prova concreta; era um fragmento',
    'do passado abolido, como um ôsso de fóssil',
    'que surge numa camada errada e destrói',
    'uma teoria geológica. Seria suficiente',
    'para fazer o Partido se esbarrendar, se fosse',
    'possível Publicá-la e tornar conhecida',
    'do mundo a sua significação. Ele continuara',
    'trabalhando. Assim que vira a fotografia,',
    'e o que queria dizer, cobrira-a com uma folha',
    'de paPel. Por sorte, ao desenrolá-la, estava',
    'de cabeça para baixo, em relação à',
    'teletela. Colocou no joelho o bloco de rascunho',
    'e empurrou a cadeira para trás, de modo',
    'a se afastar o mais possível da teletela.',
    'Manter o rosto sem expressão não era',
    'difícil, e com esfôrço se podia até',
    'controlar a respiração: mas não era',
    'Possível controlar o bater do coração,',
    'e a teletela era bastante sensível para',
    'captá-lo. Ele se quedou por dez minutos,',
    'atormentado pelo terror de que algum acidente',
    '- um pé de vento que de repente lhe limpasse',
    'a mesa, o traisse. Então, sem tornar a',
    'descobri-la, jogou a fotografia no buraco',
    'da memória, com outros papéis servidos.',
    'Dali a um minuto, talvez, não passaria',
    'de cinzas. Isso fora dez, onze anos atrás.',
    'Hoje, talvez, tivesse guardado o recorte.',
    'Era curioso que o fato de tê-lo entre os',
    'dedos lhe parecesse fazer tanta diferença,',
    'agora que a fotografia própriamente dita,',
    'e o acontecimento que registrava, não passavam',
    'de recordações. Seria menos forte o domínio',
    'do Partido sobre o passado, indagou ele,',
    'porque existira um dia uma prova que deixara',
    'de existir? Mas hoje, supondo, que fosse',
    'possível recuperá-la das cinzas, a fotografia',
    'talvez não fizesse prova alguma. Na ocasião',
    'em que descobrira o caso a Oceania não',
    'estava mais em guerra com a Eurásia, e',
    'devia ter sido aos agentes da Lestásia',
    'que os três haviam traido a pátria. Depois',
    'disso tinha havido outras reviravoltas -',
    'duas, três, não lembrava quantas. Com',
    'toda a certeza as confissões tinham sido',
    'escritas e reescritas, a ponto dos fatos',
    'e datas originais não terem a mínima',
    'importância. O passado não podia apenas',
    'ser modificado, podia ser mudado continuamente.',
    'O que mais o afligia, com uma sensação',
    'de pesadêlo, era nunca compreender com',
    'clareza por que se iniciara a tremenda ímpostura.',
    'Eram óbvias as vantagens imediatas da falsificação',
    'do passado, mas os motivos finais eram misteriosos.',
    'Ele tornou a pegar a caneta e escreveu: Compreendo',
    'COMO: não compreendo PORQUE. Indagou de',
    'seus botões, como fizera muitas vezes,',
    'se não era lunático ele próprio. Talvez',
    'um lunático seja apenas uma minoria de',
    'um. Antigamente, fora sinal de loucura acreditar',
    'que a terra gira em tôrno do sol; hoje,',
    'crer que o passado é inalterável. Podia',
    'ser o único a ter aquela crença, e sendo',
    'sózinho, lunático. A idéia de ser lunático,',
    'porém, não o perturbava grandemente.',
    'O horror era estar enganado. Tomou o livro',
    'escolar e olhou o retrato do Grande Irmão',
    'que formava o frontispício. O olhar hipnótico',
    'fixou o de Winston. Era uma fôrça enorme,',
    'fazendo pressão, algo que penetrava o',
    'crânio, se chocava contra o cérebro,',
    'amedrontava e fazia perder a fé, persuadia',
    'quase a negar a evidência dos sentidos.',
    'No fim, o Partido anunciaria que dois e dois',
    'são cinco, e todos teriam que acreditar.',
    'Era inevitável que o proclamasse mais cedo',
    'ou mais tarde: exigia-o a lógica de sua',
    'posição. Sua filosofia negava tàcitamente',
    'não apenas a validez da experiência como',
    'a própria existência da realidade externa.',
    'O bom senso era a heresia das heresias. E',
    'o que mais aterrorizava não era que matassem',
    'o cidadão por pensar diferente, mas a possibilidade',
    'de terem razão. Por que, afinal de contas,',
    'como sabemos que dois e dois são quatro?',
    'Ou que existe a lei da gravidade? Ou que',
    'o passado é inalterável? Se tanto o passado',
    'como o mundo externo só existem na mente,',
    'e se a mente em si é controlável. então?',
    'Mas não! De repente a coragem de Winston',
    'pareceu fortalecer- se. O rosto de O\'Brien,',
    'sem ser recordado por nenhuma evidente associação',
    'de idéias, surgira-lhe no espírito. E',
    'soube, com mais certeza do que antes, que',
    'O\'Brien estava do seu lado. Estava escrevendo',
    'o diário para O\'Brien, a O\'Brien; era',
    'uma espécie de carta interminável, que',
    'ninguém leria, mas que era dirigida a uma',
    'certa pessoa e por isso adquiria vibração.',
    'O Partido ordenava que o indivíduo rejeitasse',
    'a prova visual e auditiva. Era a sua ordem',
    'final, essencial. O coração de Winston',
    'fraquejou quando pensou no enorme poderio',
    'que tinha pela frente, a facilidade com que',
    'qualquer intelectual do Partido o deitaria',
    'por terra num debate, os sutis argumentos',
    'que não conseguiria compreender, e muito',
    'menos responder. E no entanto, sentia ter',
    'razão! eles estavam errados! O óbvio,',
    'o tolo, e o verdadeiro tinham que ser defendidos.',
    'Os truismos são verdadeiros, êsse é',
    'que é o fato! O mundo sólido existe,',
    'suas leis não mudam. As pedras são duras,',
    'a água é líquida, os objetos largados',
    'no ar caem sobre a crosta da terra. Com a',
    'impressão de falar com O\'Brien e também',
    'de estar fixando um importante axioma, ele',
    'escreveu: A liberdade é a liberdade de',
    'dizer que dois e dois são quatro. Admitindo-se',
    'isto, tudo o mais decorre. 8 Do fundo de',
    'uma viela vinha um cheiro de café torrado,',
    '- café de verdade, e não café Vitória',
    '- que invadia a rua. Winston parou involuntàriamente.',
    'Durante talvez dois segundos perdeu- se no',
    'mundo semi-olvidado da infância. Daí',
    'uma porta bateu, parecendo cortar o aroma',
    'como se fosse um ruido. Caminhára vários',
    'quilômetros no leito da rua e a variz ulcerada',
    'estava pulsando. Era a segunda vez em três',
    'semanas que falhava a um sarau no Centro',
    'Comunal: gesto audacioso, pois podia ter',
    'a certeza de que era cuidadosamente verificado',
    'o número de presenças no Centro. Em princípio,',
    'um membro do Partido não tinha horas vagas,',
    'e não ficava nunca só, exceto na cama.',
    'Supunha-se que quando não estivesse trabalhando,',
    'comendo ou dormindo, devia participar de',
    'alguma recreação comunal; era sempre',
    'ligeiramente perigoso fazer qualquer coisa',
    'que sugerisse o gôsto pela solidão, mesmo',
    'que fosse apenas passear sózinho. Em Novilíngua',
    'havia uma palavra para isso: proprivida,',
    'e significava individualismo e excentricidade.',
    'Mas aquela noite, ao sair do Ministério,',
    'tentara-o a calidez do ar de abril. O azul',
    'do céu era o mais morno que havia visto',
    'aquele ano, e de súbito, pareceu-lhe intolerável',
    'a longa e ruidosa noitada no Centro, com',
    'os jogos aborrecidos e cansativos, as conferências,',
    'a camaradagem forçada, lubrificada pelo',
    'gin. Num impulso, afastara-se da parada do',
    'ônibus e vagueara pelo labirinto de Londres,',
    'primeiro para o sul, depois para o leste,',
    'depois para o norte, perdendo-se em ruas',
    'desconhecidas e pouco ligando à direção',
    'tomada. "Se há esperança," escreveu no',
    'diário, "está nos proles." As palavras',
    'tornavam-lhe à mente, expressão de uma',
    'verdade mística e de um palpável absurdo.',
    'Encontrava-se nas favelas de cor parda, que',
    'ficavam ao norte e a leste do que fora um',
    'dia a estação de São Pancrácio. Subia',
    'uma rua calçada a lages, de casinhas de',
    'dois andares, com portas escalavradas que',
    'abriam sobre a via pública, e que de certo',
    'modo sugeríam buracos de ratos. Entre as',
    'pedras da rua havia, aqui e ali, poças',
    'de água imunda. Entrando e saindo das casas',
    'escuras, e embarafustando, pelos becos estreitos',
    'que desembocavam dos dois lados da rua, o',
    'povo formigava numa quantidade incrível',
    '- moças em plena floração, os lábios',
    'grosseiramente pintados; rapazes que perseguiam',
    'as moças; mulheres inchadas e desgraciosas',
    'que eram imagem do que seriam as moças',
    'dali a dez anos, velhos arcados, arrastando',
    'os pés; crianças descalças e esfarrapadas',
    'que brincavam nas poças dágua e se dispersavam',
    'aos gritos furiosos das mães. Talvez a',
    'quarta parte das janelas da rua estavam quebradas',
    'e remendadas com papelão. A maioria não',
    'prestava atenção em Winston; alguns o',
    'fitavam com uma espécie de disfarçada',
    'curiosidade. Duas mulheres monstruosas, com',
    'braços cor de tijolo cruzados sobre o avental,',
    'conversavam diante duma porta. Winston percebeu',
    'trechos de frase:, Sim, eu disse prela.',
    'Tá muito bom, eu disse. Mas se tu tivesse',
    'no meu lugar tu fazia que nem eu fiz. é',
    'faci criticá, eu falei, mas não tens',
    'os mermo problema que eu., Ah, fez a outra',
    '- é isso mermo. Escritinho. As vozes estridentes',
    'calaram-se de súbito. As mulheres estudaram-no',
    'em silêncio hostil, quando ele passou.',
    'Mas não era exatamente hostilidade; era',
    'mais uma espécie de cautela, um enrijamento',
    'momentâneo, como à passagem de um animal',
    'raro. O macacão azul não podia ser comum',
    'numa rua como aquela. Na verdade, era imprudente',
    'ser visto em tais lugares, a não ser que',
    'se tivesse uma tarefa específica. As patrulhas',
    'poderiam detê-lo se o vissem. "Posso examinar',
    'teus papéis, camarada? Que estás fazendo',
    'aqui? A que hora saiste do trabalho? é',
    'o teu caminho habitual para casa?" e assim',
    'por diante. Não que houvesse algum regulamento',
    'contra o regresso ao lar por um caminho diferente,',
    'mas bastava para chamar a atenção da',
    'Polícia do Pensamento. De repente, a rua',
    'toda se agitou. De todos os lados soaram',
    'gritos de advertência. Os populares se',
    'escondiam em casa como coelhos. Uma moça',
    'saltou de uma porta, pouco adiante de Winston,',
    'agarrou uma criancinha que brincava numa',
    'poça, embrulhou-a no avental e tornou à',
    'casa, num pulo. No mesmo instante um homem',
    'de terno preto, amassado como uma sanfona,',
    'e que surgira de um bêco lateral, correu',
    'para Winston, apontando o céu, muito nervoso:',
    '- Vapor!, gritou., Cuidado, patrão! Estoura',
    'já! Deita logo! Não se sabia porque os',
    'proles tinham dado o apelido de vapor" às',
    'bombas-foguete. Winston prontamente se jogou',
    'de bruços. Os proles raro se enganavam',
    'quando faziam essa advertência. Pareciam',
    'possuir uma espécie de instinto que lhes',
    'dízia, com vários segundos de antecedência,',
    'que um foguete estava chegando, embora voassem',
    'mais rápido que o som. Winston protegeu',
    'a cabeça com os antebraços. Houve um',
    'ribombo que pareceu fazer o chão ofegar.',
    'Uma chuva de detritos caiu-lhe nas costas.',
    'Quando se levantou viu que estava coberto',
    'de fragmentos de vidro da janela próxima.',
    'Continuou andando. A bomba demolira um grupo',
    'de casas duzentos metros além, na mesma',
    'rua. Elevava-se para o céu uma nuvem negra',
    'de fumaça, e debaixo dela outra de pó',
    'de caliça, na qual já se formava a multidão,',
    'cercando os escombros. Diante dele, no lagedo,',
    'havia um montículo de reboco e estuque,',
    'e no meio uma faixa vermelho vivo. Quando',
    'chegou perto viu que era uma mão humana',
    'decepada pelo pulso. Fóra o corte sanguinolento,',
    'a mão esbranquiçara de tal modo que parecia',
    'um modêlo de gesso. Com um pontapé atirou',
    'a mão à sarjeta e depois, para evitar',
    'o povaréu, dobrou uma ruela à direita.',
    'Dali a três ou quatro minutos deixara a',
    'área afetada pela bomba, e o sórdido',
    'formigamento da vida das ruas continuava',
    'como se nada tivesse sucedido. Eram quase',
    'vinte horas, e as lojas de bebidas frequentadas',
    'pelos proles ("bares", eram chamados) estavam',
    'cheias de fregueses. Pelas emporcalhadas',
    'portas de vai-vem, que se abriam e fechavam',
    'sem cessar, vinha um cheiro de urina, serragem',
    'e cerveja azeda. Num ângulo formado pela',
    'fachada saliente de uma casa, três homens',
    'estavam parados, muito juntos, estudando',
    'um jornal seguro pelo do meio, e que os dois',
    'outros liam por cima do ombro dele. Mesmo',
    'antes de chegar perto o suficiente para lhes',
    'distinguir as feições, Winston pôde',
    'ver como estavam absortos. Devia ser algo',
    'muito sério o que lhes prendia a atenção.',
    'Estava a alguns passos de distância quando',
    'de \' repente o grupo se afastou e dois homens',
    'se puseram a altercar violentamente. Por',
    'um minuto, até pareceu que fossem às',
    'vias de fato., Não escutas o que t\'digo?',
    'Pois se tou dizeno que nenhum número acabado',
    'em sete já ganhou há mais de um ano e',
    'dois meis!, Ganhô sim!, Ganhô nada!',
    'Lá na terra tomei nota de tudo, doizano,',
    'num pedaço de papé. Escrevi que nem relógio:',
    'direitinho. E \'tdigo que nenhum número',
    'acabado em sete., Ganhô sim! Espera',
    'aí que já me lembro do danado do número.',
    'Quatro, zero, sete, era a terminação.',
    'Foi em fevereiro. segunda semana de fevereiro.',
    '- Fevereiro a vovózinha! Eu tomei nota',
    'preto no branco. E t\'digo que nenhum número.',
    'Ora, cala a boca!, disse o terceiro homem.',
    'Estavam falando da Loteria. A uns trinta',
    'metros de distância, Winston olhou para',
    'trás. Ainda discutiam, rosto apaixonado,',
    'febril. A Loteria, com seus enormes premios',
    'semanais, era o acontecimento público a',
    'que os proles davam a maior atenção.',
    'Era provável que houvesse milhões de',
    'proles para quem a Loteria era o principal',
    'senão o único motivo de continuar a viver.',
    'Era o seu deleite, sua loucura, seu anódino,',
    'seu estimulante intelectual. Quando se tratava',
    'da Loteria, até gente que mal sabia ler',
    'e escrever fazia intrincados cálculos e',
    'fantásticas proezas de memória. Havia',
    'um exército de homens que ganhava a vida',
    'graças à simples venda de sistemas, previsões',
    'e amuletos. Winston nada tinha que ver com',
    'a exploração da Loteria, que era administrada',
    'pelo Ministério da Fartura, mas sabia (como',
    'sabiam todos do Partido) que em grande parte',
    'os premios eram imaginários. Na realidade,',
    'só eram pagas pequenas quantias, sendo',
    'pessoas inexistentes os ganhadores da sorte',
    'grande. Na ausência de qualquer intercomunicação',
    'real entre uma parte e outra da Oceania,',
    'não era difícil arranjar isso. Mas se',
    'esperança havia, estava nos proles. Era',
    'preciso agarrar-se a isso com unhas e dentes.',
    'Quando se traduzia o pensamento em palavras,',
    'parecia razoável: mas quando se consideravam',
    'os seres humanos que passavam pela calçada',
    'a idéia se\'transformava em ato de fé.',
    'A rua que tomara descia um declive. Teve',
    'a sensação de já ter andado pela vizinhança,',
    'e de haver por perto uma avenida principal.',
    'Dalguma parte chegou-lhe aos ouvidos uma',
    'gritaria geral. A rua fez uma curva brusca',
    'e acabou nuns degraus que conduziam a um',
    'beco em nivel inferior, onde alguns barraqueiros',
    'vendiam legumes murchos. Naquele momento,',
    'Winston recordou-se donde estava. O beco',
    'dava para a rua principal, e depois da próxima',
    'esquina, a menos de cinco minutos dali, ficava',
    'o bricabraque onde comprara o livro branco',
    'que era agora seu diário. E a pequena papelaria,',
    'onde comprara a caneta e o tinteiro. Deteve-se',
    'um instante no alto da escada. Do outro lado',
    'do beco havia um barzinho miserável cujas',
    'janelas pareciam embaciadas mas na verdade',
    'estavam apenas cobertas de pó. Um ancião',
    'arcado mas ativo, com bigode branco eriçado',
    'como um camarão, empurrou a porta e entrou.',
    'Contemplando-o, Winston de repente imaginou',
    'que o velho, que devia ter no mínimo oitenta',
    'anos, já devia ser maduro ao tempo da Revolução.',
    'Ele e uns poucos outros eram os últimos',
    'elos vivos com o desaparecido mundo capitalista.',
    'No Partido não havia muita gente que tivesse',
    'idéia formada antes da Revolução. A',
    'geração mais antiga tinha sido, na sua',
    'maioria, liquidada nos grandes expurgos das',
    'décadas de 1950 a 70, e as sobras, aterrorizadas,',
    'se haviam refugiado na mais completa submissão',
    'intelectual. Se ainda restasse vivo alguem',
    'capaz de fazer uma descrição verídica',
    'das condições na primeira metade do século,',
    'só podia ser um prole. De repente, veio',
    'à mente de Winston o trecho do livro de',
    'história que copiara no seu diário, e',
    'um impulso lunático o dominou. Entraria',
    'no bar, travaria conhecimento com o velho',
    'e o interrogaria. Haveria de pedir-lhe: "Fale-me',
    'de sua vida quando o sr. era menino. Como',
    'era, naqueles dias? As coisas eram melhores',
    'que hoje, ou eram piores?" Apressadamente,',
    'como se tivesse recêio de perder a coragem,',
    'desceu os degraus e atravessou a rua estreita.',
    'Era loucura, evidentemente. Como de praxe,',
    'não havia regulamento contra a conversa',
    'com os proles nem a frequencia de seus bares,',
    'mas era ato muito fora do comum para passar',
    'despercebido. Se as patrulhas aparecessem',
    'ele poderia desculpar-se dizendo que se sentira',
    'mal, porém era pouco provável que lhe',
    'dessem crédito. Empurrou a porta, e um',
    'horrendo cheiro de queijo e cerveja azeda,',
    'atingiu-o em cheio. Quando entrou o barulho',
    'das vozes diminuiu talvez a metade do volume.',
    'Por trás das costas podia sentir todo mundo',
    'a examinar-lhe o macacão. Um jôgo de',
    'flechinhas ao alvo, no outro extremo da sala,',
    'interrompeu-se por uns trinta segundos. O',
    'velho que ele seguira estava no balcão,',
    'altercando com o botequineiro, um rapaz corpulento,',
    'de nariz de gancho e braços enormes. Vários',
    'fregueses do bar, com os copos na mão,',
    'observavam a cena., Te pedi com educação,',
    'não foi?, insistiu o velho endireitando',
    'os ombros belicosamente., Qué me dizê',
    'que não têm uma caneca de pinta nesta',
    'birosca?, E que demônio de troço é',
    'uma pinta?, quis saber o botequineiro, inclinando-se',
    'para a frente e apoiando-se no balcão com',
    'as pontas dos dedos., Oia só ele! Botequineiro',
    'que nem sabe o que é pinta! Ué, uma pinta',
    'é a metade duma quarta, e tem quatro quartas',
    'no galão. Daqui a pouco tenho que te ensiná',
    'o abc!, Nunca escuitei falá nisso, disse',
    'o rapaz., Litro e meio- litro. é só',
    'o que servimos. Aí estão as canecas na',
    'sua frente., Gosto de pinta, persistiu',
    'o velho., Você bem que me podia servi',
    'uma pinta. Não tinha essas besteiras de',
    'litro quando eu era moço., Quando tu era',
    'moço nós todos morava trepado nas arve',
    '- disse o botequineiro, olhando de soslaio',
    'para os outros fregueses. Houve uma gargalhada',
    'geral, e pareceu desaparecer o mal-estar',
    'causado pela entrada de Winston. Sob a barba',
    'branca que despontava, o velho corou violentamente.',
    'Voltou-se, falando sózinho, e tropeçou',
    'em Winston, que o segurou delicadamente pelo',
    'braço., Permites que te ofereça um gole?',
    '- O sr. é um cavalheiro, disse o outro,',
    'tornando a endireitar os ombros. Não parecia',
    'ter notado o macacão azul de Winston. -',
    'Uma pinta!, acrescentou, agressivo, dirigindo-',
    'se ao botequineiro., Uma pinta da boa! O',
    'taverneiro serviu dois meios-litros de cerveja',
    'marron escura em canecas que enxaguara num',
    'balde debaixo do balcão. Nos bares dos',
    'proles só se podia tomar cerveja. Não',
    'lhes era permitido tomar gin, conquanto,',
    'na prática, fosse facílimo arranjá-lo.',
    'O jôgo das flechinhas se reanimara, e os',
    'homens encostados ao balcão, haviam reiniciado',
    'a conversa sobre a Loteria. Por um momento,',
    'fora esquecida a presença de Winston. Debaixo',
    'da janela havia uma mesa junto à qual podia',
    'conversar à vontade com o velho. Era um',
    'perigo horrível, mas pelo menos não havia',
    'teletela no salão, o que verificara logo',
    'ao entrar., Ele bem que podia me serví',
    'uma pinta,, queixou-se o velho, sentando.',
    '- Meio litro não chega. Não satisfais.',
    'E um litro é muito. Me faz a bixiga trabalhá.',
    'E o preço!?, Deves ter visto muita coisa',
    'mudar, desde mocinho, começou Winston,',
    'experimentando. Os olhos azul pálido do',
    'homem percorreram o bar do alvo das flechas',
    'ao balcão, do balcão à porta dos "Homens"',
    'como se as mudanças tivessem ocorrido ali',
    'mesmo., A cerveja era mió, disse por',
    'fim., E mais barata! Quando eu era moço,',
    'cerveja clara, da boa, custava quatro dinheiros',
    'a pinta. Isso antes da guerra, naturalmente.',
    '- Que guerra?, indagou Winston., De todas',
    'as guerras, respondeu o velho, vagamente.',
    'Levantou o copo e tornou a endireitar os',
    'ombros., Com os meus mió voto de saúde',
    'e filicidade. No pescoço magro o pomo de',
    'Adão, muito pontudo, fez um rapidíssimo',
    'movimento de subir e descer, e a cerveja',
    'sumiu. Winston foi ao balcão e voltou com',
    'dois outros meios-litros. O velho parecia',
    'ter esquecido seus preconceitos., és muito',
    'mais velho que eu, disse Winston., Devias',
    'ser adulto antes de eu nascer. Deves lembrar',
    'como era a vida antigamente, antes da Revolução.',
    'Gente da minha idade não sabe nada daquela',
    'época. Só podemos ler nos livros, e o',
    'que dizem os livros pode não ser verdade.',
    'Gostaria de conhecer tua opinião a respeito.',
    'Os livros de história dizem que antes da',
    'Revolução a vida era completamente diferente',
    'do que é hoje. Reinava a mais terrível',
    'opressão, injustiça, pobreza, pior do',
    'que tudo que imaginamos. Aqui em Londres',
    'a maioria do povo nunca tinha bastante o',
    'que comer, do berço ao túmulo. Metade',
    'da população não tinha sapato. TrabalhaVa',
    'doze horas por dia, saía da escola aos',
    'nove anos, dormiam dez em cada quarto. Ao',
    'mesmo tempo havia um grupinho, de alguns',
    'milhares, os chamados capitalistas, ricos',
    'e poderosos. Eram donos de tudo quanto existia.',
    'Moravam em casarões lindos com trinta empregados,',
    'passeavam de automóvel e carruagem de quatro',
    'cavalos, bebiam champanha, usavam cartolas.',
    'O rosto do velho se iluminou., Cartolas!',
    '- disse ele., Engraçado que fale nisso.',
    'A mema coisa me veiu na cabeça onte, não',
    'sei pruquê. tava pensano, fais tanto tempo',
    'que não vejo uma cartola! Acabaro, parece.',
    'A última veis que usei uma foi no entêrro',
    'de minha cunhada. E isso foi. Ah, bom,',
    'não sei mais a data, mas foi uns cinqüenta',
    'anos atrais. Naturalmente aluguei ela prô',
    'entêrro, compreende, né?, As cartolas',
    'não têm importância, disse Winston,',
    'com paciência., A coisa é que êsses',
    'capitalistas, mais alguns advogados e padres,',
    'e outros que tais, que viviam no meio deles,',
    'eram os donos da terra. Tudo existia para',
    'o gôzo deles. O povinho comum, os trabalhadores,',
    'eram escravos deles. Podiam fazer o que bem',
    'entendessem. Podiam mandar-vos como gado',
    'para o Canadá. Podiam dormir com vossas',
    'filhas, se quisessem. Podiam mandar bater-vos',
    'com uma coisa chamada gato de nove caudas.',
    'Tinhas que tirar o boné quando passavas',
    'por eles. Cada capitalista andava com um',
    'bando de lacaios que. O rosto do velho',
    'tornou a iluminar-se., Lacaios!, disse',
    'ele., Palavra que não escuito já fais',
    'tempão. Lacaios. Me fais vortá muito',
    'zano pra trais. Me lembro. chi, nem me',
    'alembro quanto tempo! . que eu às veis',
    'ia pro Aide Parque escuitá os cara fazeno',
    'discurso. Exército da Sarvação, Católico,',
    'judeu, indiano. todo mundo. E havia um',
    'sojeito, não sei do nome dele, mas era',
    'um faladô batuta, isso era. E metia o pau.',
    '"Lacaios!" gritava. "Lacaios da burguesia!',
    'Cupichas da classe dominante!" Parasita era',
    'outra palavra bonita. E hienas, ele falava',
    'muito em hiena. O sior compreende, né,',
    'ele tava falando contro Partido Trabalhista.',
    'Winston teve a impressão de que as linhas',
    'se haviam cruzado., O que na verdade desejo',
    'saber é isto: achas que hoje há mais',
    'liberdade do que naquele tempo? és tratado',
    'mais como ser humano? No passado os ricaços,',
    'os que mandavam., A Câmara dos Lordes',
    '- completou o velho, reminiscente., Vá',
    'lá, a Câmara dos Lordes. O que te pergunto',
    'é isto, essa gente te tratava como inferior,',
    'só porque era rica e tu eras pobre? Não',
    'é verdade que tinhas de chamar os ricos',
    'de "senhor" e tirar o boné quando passavas',
    'por eles? O velho pareceu meditar profundamente.',
    'Bebeu talvez a quarta parte da caneca de',
    'chope antes de responder., Sim. eles gostavo',
    'que a gente cumprimentasse eles co boné.',
    'Era siná de respeito, né? Eu não concordava,',
    'mais fazia. Tinha de fazê. E era comum',
    '- apenas repito o que li, nos livros de história',
    '- que essa gente e sua criadagem empurrassem',
    'os outros para a sargeta?, Uma vez um cara',
    'me empurrou, disse o velho., Me lembro',
    'como se fosse onte. Era a noite da Regata',
    '- ficavam levado da breca em noite de Regata',
    '- e eu bumba num rapaz na avenida Shaftesbury.',
    'Todo impelicado, o zinho, camisa de peito',
    'duro, cartola, sobretudo preto. Ia indo em',
    'zigue-zague pela calçada e eu esbarrei',
    'nele sem querer. Ele disse "Por que não',
    'olha para onde vai?" disse. E eu disse "Cê',
    'pensa que comprou o raio da calçada?" Ele',
    'disse "Eu te torço êsse pescoço duma',
    'figa se você se mete a sebo . .. Cê',
    'tá bebo, já te mando prendê," eu disse.',
    'E o sr. não acredita, mas ele botô as',
    'mãos no meu peito e me deu um empurrão',
    'que quaji me atira debaixo das roda dum ônibu.',
    'Daí eu, uai, eu era moço, e ia lhe largá',
    'uma daquelas. Uma espécie de desespêro',
    'dominou Winston. A memória do velho não',
    'passava de um monturo de pormenores atoa.',
    'Poderia interrogá-lo o dia inteiro sem',
    'obter nenhum dado genuino. De certo modo,',
    'as histórias do Partido talvez fossem verdadeiras:',
    'podiam até ser completamente verídicas.',
    'Fez a última tentativa., Talvez não',
    'me expliquei bem,, disse., O que quero',
    'dizer é o seguinte. Vives há muito tempo.',
    'Viveste metade da vida antes da Revolução.',
    'Em 1925, por exemplo já eras adulto. Pelo',
    'que recordas, podes dizer que a vida em 1925',
    'era melhor que agora, ou pior? Qual escolherias,',
    'quando preferias viver, naquela época ou',
    'agora? O homem fitou longamente o alvo das',
    'flechinhas. Terminou o chope, mais devagar',
    'que antes. Quando falou foi com um ar tolerante,',
    'filosófico, como se a cerveja o tivesse',
    'abrandado., Sei o que o sr. espera que eu',
    'diga. Espera que diga que preferia ser moço\'tra',
    'veis. A maioria das pessoa diz que queria',
    'ser moça, se o sr. perguntá. A gente',
    'tem saúde e fôrça quando é mais novo.',
    'Quando se chega a esta idade não se tem',
    'mais saúde. Meus pé dói muito e minha',
    'bixiga então nem se fala. Seis a sete veis',
    'por noite tenho de levantá, Mais tem sua',
    'vantage, sê velho. Não tenho tanta dor',
    'de cabeça. Nada de muié, e é formidave.',
    'Há uns trinta ano que não ando com muié,',
    'se o sr. credita. Nem quis, posso jurá.',
    'Winston encostou-se ao peitoril da janela.',
    'Não adiantava continuar. Ia comprar mais',
    'cerveja quando o velho de repente se levantou',
    'e se encaminhou rápido para o mictório',
    'fedorento, ao lado da sala. O segundo meio-litro',
    'estava funcionando. Winston ficou um minuto',
    'ou dois olhando a caneca vazia, e mal notou',
    'quando os pés o levaram de novo para a',
    'rua. Dali a vinte anos, no máximo, refletiu',
    'ele, a pergunta simples e momentosa "Antes',
    'da Revolução a vida era melhor que agora?"',
    'deixaria de ser respondível para todo o',
    'sempre. De fato, porém, já era irrespondível,',
    'pois alguns dispersos sobreviventes do mundo',
    'antigo eram incapazes de comparar uma época',
    'com outra. Lembravam-se de um milhão de',
    'coisas inúteis, duma briga com um colega,',
    'a busca de uma bomba de bicicleta, a expressão',
    'no rosto de uma irmã falecida, o rodopio',
    'da poeira numa manhã de vento, setenta',
    'anos atrás: mas todos os fatos relevantes',
    'já estavam fora do alcance da sua visão.',
    'Eram como a formiga, que pode ver pequenos',
    'objetos, mas não enxerga os grandes. E',
    'quando a memória falhava, e os registos',
    'escritos eram falsificados, era forçoso',
    'aceitar a assertiva do Partido de que tinham',
    'melhorado as condições da vida humana,',
    'porque não existia, nem jamais poderia',
    'existir, qualquer padrão de comparação.',
    'Naquele momento o fio dos seus pensamentos',
    'se deteve de repente. Ele parou e levantou',
    'o olhar. Estava numa rua estreita, com algumas',
    'lojinhas escuras perdidas entre residencias.',
    'Bem por cima de sua cabeça pendiam três',
    'fanadas esferas de metal, que tinham jeito',
    'de haver sido douradas. Pareceu-lhe conhecer',
    'o lugar. Pois, claro! Estava diante da quinquilharia',
    'onde comprara o diário! Um arrepio de medo',
    'o agitou. Já fora bastante ousado comprar',
    'o livro, e jurara nunca mais se aproximar',
    'da casa. Entretanto, no momento em que deixava',
    'o pensamento vaguear, os pés o levavam',
    'para lá, por iniciativa própria. Era',
    'exatamente contra impulsos suicidas dessa',
    'natureza que esperara se defender, iniciando',
    'o diário. Observou ao mesmo tempo que embora',
    'fossem quase vinte e uma horas, a loja continuava',
    'aberta. Com a sensação de que daria menos',
    'na vista entrando do que ficando na calçada,',
    'entrou. Se perguntassem, responderia, plausivelmente,',
    'que procurava lâminas de barba. O proprietário',
    'acabava de pendurar do teto um mal cheiroso',
    'candieiro de azeite. Era um homem de seus',
    'sessenta anos , frágil e arcado, de nariz',
    'comprido, benévolo, olhos calmos deformados',
    'pelos óculos grossos, Tinha cabelo quase',
    'branco, mas as sobrancelhas eram bastas e',
    'pretas. Os óculos, e seus movimentos exageradamente',
    'gentis, e o fato de usar paletó de veludo',
    'negro, davam-lhe um ar indefinível de intelectualidade,',
    'como se fosse literato, ou músico talvez.',
    'A voz era suave, parecia desbotada e sua',
    'prosódia era menos dissonante do que a',
    'da maioria dos proles., Reconheci o sr.',
    'na calçada,, disse, imediatamente., Foi',
    'o senhor que me comprou aquele álbum de',
    'recordações. Papel lindo, um mimo para',
    'uma moça. Linho creme, chamava-se. Há',
    'uns. digamos cinqüenta anos. que não',
    'se fabrica papel assim., Contemplou Winston',
    'por cima das lentes., Procura alguma coisa',
    'em partícular? Ou só quer uma olhada?',
    'Ia passando, respondeu Winston, aéreo.',
    '- Vim dar uma olhada. Não quero nada. Perfeitamente',
    '- concordou o homem., Não creio que pudesse',
    'satisfazê-lo., Fez um gesto de desculpas',
    'com a mão., O sr. está vendo. Não',
    'tenho nada. Loja vazia. Cá entre nós,',
    'está morto o ramo de antiquário. Ninguém',
    'mais o quer. Nem há estoque. Móveis,',
    'porcelanas, cristais, tudo foi acabando.',
    'E naturalmente o que era de metal foi fundido.',
    'Há muitos anos que não vejo um castiçal',
    'de latão. Ao invés, a lojinha estava',
    'atulhada de mercadorias, mas coisa alguma',
    'valia nada. Mal se podia andar, porque o',
    'chão estava tomado por pilhas de molduras',
    'empoeiradas. Na janela havia bandejas com',
    'porcas e parafuso, formões sem corte, canivetes',
    'de folha partida, relógios enegrecidos',
    'que nem fingiam poder funcionar, e uma variedade',
    'enorme de bricabraque. Apenas numa mesinha',
    'ao canto havia uma miscelânea, caixas',
    'de rapé, laqueadas, broches de ágate,',
    'coisas assim, que parecia incluir algo interessante.',
    'Quando Winston dela se aproximou, seú olhar',
    'foi atraído porum objeto liso, redondo,',
    'que brilhava suavemente, à luz do lampeão.',
    'Tomou-o na mão e examinou-o. Era um pesado',
    'bloco de vidro, hçmisférico, e tanto',
    'a textura como o colorido do cristal ostentavam',
    'estranha suavidade, como a da água da chuva.',
    'Bem no centro, ampliado pela superfície',
    'convexa, havia um objeto cor de rosa, em',
    'voluta, que lembrava uma rosa ou uma anêmona',
    'dó mar., Que é isto?, perguntou Wihston,',
    'fascinado., é coral, informou o velho.',
    '- Deve ter vindo do oceano índico. Costumavam',
    'embuti-lo assim, em vidro. Isso foi feito',
    'no mínimo há cem anos. Quem sabe até',
    'mais., é lindo, suspirou Winston., é',
    'mesmo, concordou o velho, com ar de apreciador.',
    '- Mas pouca gente o diria hoje., Tossiu.',
    '- Se por acaso o sr. quiser comprar, são',
    'quatro dólares. Lembro-me duma época',
    'em que uma coisa dessas renderia oito libras',
    'esterlinas, e oito libras eram, .. bom, não',
    'sei mais calcular. mas era um bocado de',
    'dinheiro. Hoje porém, quem liga às antiguidades',
    'genuinas, as poucas que restam? Winston pagou',
    'imediatamente os quatro dólares e meteu',
    'no bolso o cobiçado objeto. Atraía-o',
    'não tanto a sua beleza como o fato de pertencer',
    'a uma época muito diferente da atual. O',
    'vidro macio, límpido como água da chuva,',
    'não se parecia com vidro algum, dos que',
    'conhecia. A coisa era-lhe duplamente atraente',
    'por ser inútil, embora adivinhasse que',
    'fora usada outrora como pêso de papéis;',
    'pesava muito no bolso, mas por sorte não',
    'fazia muito volume. Era um objeto estranho,',
    'comprometedor mesmo, para um membro do Partido',
    'possuir. Tudo quanto fosse antigo, e tudo',
    'quanto fosse belo, era sempre vagamente suspeito.',
    'O velho tornara-se bem mais loquaz depois',
    'de receber os quatro dólares. Winston percebeu',
    'que teria aceito três, ou mesmo dois. -',
    'Lá em cima tenho um quarto, que o sr. talvez',
    'queira conhecer, disse., Não há grande',
    'coisa, algumas peças apenas. Deixe-me acender',
    'o lampeão. Acendeu outra lâmpada e, sempre',
    'arcado, tomou a dianteira, subindo os degraus',
    'altos e gastos. Ganharam um corredor minúsculo',
    'e entraram num cômodo que não dava para',
    'a rua, abrindo sobre um pátio lageado e',
    'uma floresta de coifas de chaminé. Winston',
    'reparou que o quarto estava mobiliado como',
    'se alguém ainda o habitasse. Havia um pedaço',
    'de tapete no soalho, um ou dois quadros na',
    'parede, e uma poltrona funda, mal conservada,',
    'junto à lareira. Um carrilhão antigo,',
    'com mostrador de doze horas, tiquetaqueava',
    'na escarpa. Sob a janela, ocupando quase',
    'a quarta parte do cômodo, uma cama enorme,',
    'de casal, ainda com o colchão., Usei o',
    'quarto até minha mulher morrer, disse',
    'o velho, em tom de meia desculpa., Estou',
    '-vendendo a mobília aos pouquinhos. Essa',
    'cama de mogno é linda, ou seria, se fosse',
    'possível livrá-la dos percevejos. Creio',
    'porém que o sr. julga um pouco sem jeito.',
    'Levantou o lampeão, para iluminar todo',
    'o quarto, e sob luz morna e amarelada, o',
    'lugar parecia curiosamente convidativo. Pela',
    'cabeça de Winston perpassou a idéia de',
    'que seria facílimo alugar o quarto por',
    'alguns dólares semanais, se tivesse coragem',
    'de se arriscar. Era uma idéia louca, impossível,',
    'a ser abandonada imediatamente. Mas o quarto',
    'despertara nele uma espécie de nostalgia,',
    'de saudade ancestral. Parecia-lhe saber exatamente',
    'que impressão dava sentar-se num quarto',
    'assim, numa poltrona ao pé do fogo, com',
    'os pés na guarda e a chaleira no gancho:',
    'completamente só, em completa segurança,',
    'sem ninguém a fitá-lo, sem voz a persegui-lo,',
    'sem ruido algum além do tiquetaque do relógio',
    'e o chilrear da chaleira., Não há teletela!',
    '- murmurou, embevecido., Nunca tive dinheiro',
    'para comprar uma, disse o velho., E não',
    'sinto falta. Ali tenho uma bonita mesa de',
    'abrir, naquele canto. Só que se o sr. quiser',
    'usá-la tem de trocar as dobradiças. No',
    'outro canto havia uma pequena estante de',
    'livros e Winston já se encaminhara para',
    'ela. Só continha porcaria. A busca e destruição',
    'de livros fora realizada no bairro dos proles',
    'com o mesmo método que nos outros. Era',
    'pouco provável que ainda existisse na Oceania',
    'algum livro impresso antes de 1960. O velho,',
    'ainda empunhando a lâmpada, estava parado',
    'na frente de um quadro emoldurado em paurosa,',
    'prêso à parede diante da lareira., Se',
    'o sr. estiver interessado em gravuras antigas.',
    '- começou, delicadamente. Winston atravessou',
    'o quarto para examinar o quadro. Era uma',
    'gravura em aço de um edifício oval, de',
    'janelas retangulares, e uma pequena tôrre',
    'na frente. Havia uma grade de ferro em tôrno',
    'do prédio, e atrás algo semelhante a',
    'uma estátua. Winston fitou-o alguns momentos.',
    'Parecialhe vagamente familiar, embora não',
    'se lembrasse da estátua., A moldura está',
    'fixa na parede, explicou o velho., Se quiser,',
    'posso desaparafusá-la., Conheço êsse',
    'prédio, anunciou Winston por fim., Está',
    'em ruinas, agora. Fica no meio da rua do',
    'Palácio da Justiça., é isso, perto',
    'do Fôro. Foi bombardeado em. há muitos',
    'anos. Era uma igreja, antigamente. Chamava-se',
    'S. Clemente dos Dinamarqueses., Sorriu,',
    'com ar de desculpa, como quem dissesse algo',
    'ligeiramente ridículo e acrescentou: -',
    'Laranjas e limões, dizem os sinos de S.',
    'Clemente!, Como é?, Ah. Laranjas e',
    'limões, dizem os sinos de S. Clemente.',
    'Uma modinha que havia quando eu era menino.',
    'Não me lembro como é que continuava,',
    'mas sei que acabava assim: Aí vem uma luz',
    'para te levar para a cama, Aí vem um machado',
    'para te cortar a cabeça. Era uma espécie',
    'de dança. Faziam um corredor de mãos',
    'dadas e braços erguidos e a gente passava',
    'por baixo. Quando chegava em "para te cortar',
    'a cabeça," desciam os braços e prendiam',
    'a pessoa. Era tudo com o nome das igrejas.',
    'Tôdas as igrejas de Londres, isto é,',
    'as principais. Winston indagou vagamente',
    'de si mesmo a que século pertenceria a',
    'igreja. Era sempre difícil determinar a',
    'idade de um prédio londrino. Tudo quanto',
    'fosse grande e imponente, e de aparência',
    'relativamente nova, era automaticamente declarado',
    'post-revolucionário, enquanto que tudo',
    'mais, evidentemente antigo, era atribuido',
    'a um período obscuro denominado Idade Média.',
    'Afirmava-se que séculos e séculos de',
    'capitalismo não haviam produzido nada de',
    'valor. Da arquitetura não se podia aprender',
    'mais história do que dos livros. Ruas,',
    'pedras comemorativas, estátuas, nomes de',
    'ruas, tudo quanto pudesse lançar luz sobre',
    'o passado fora sistemàticamente alterado.',
    '- Nunca soube que foi uma igreja., Ainda',
    'há uma porção delas em pé, disse',
    'o velho, embora as utilizem para outros',
    'fins. Como era mesmo a cantiga? Ah, já',
    'sei: "Laranjas e limões, dizem os sinos',
    'de S. Clemente, Me deves três vintens,',
    'dizem os sinos de S. Martinho" é o que',
    'lembro. O vintém era uma moedinha de cobre,',
    'meio parecida com um centavo., E S. Martinho,',
    'onde ficava?, S. Martinho? Ainda está',
    'no lugar. Fica na praça da Vitória, ao',
    'lado da pinacoteca. Um edifício com fachada',
    'triangular, colunata, egrande escadaria.',
    'Winston conhecia bem o prédio. Era um museu',
    'destinado a diversas exposições de propaganda',
    '- miniaturas de bombas- foguetes e Fortalezas',
    'Flutuantes, modelos de cera representando',
    'atrocidades do inimigo e assim por diante.',
    '- Chamava-se S. Martinho dos Campos, acrescentou',
    'o velho, mas não me lembro de nenhum campo',
    'naquelas paragens. Winston não comprou',
    'a gravura. Teria sido uma propriedade ainda',
    'mais incongruente do que o pêso de papéis,',
    'e impossível de levar para casa, a não',
    'ser que a tirasse da moldura. Mas se deixou',
    'ficar alguns minutos com o velho, cujo nome,',
    'descobriu, não era Weeks, como se poderia',
    'concluir do letreiro na fachada, mas Charrington.',
    'Ao que parecia, o sr. Charrington era um',
    'viuvo de sessenta e três anos e residia',
    'na loja havia trinta. Todo êsse tempo tencionara',
    'mudar o nome da placa, mas nunca tomara a',
    'decisão final. Durante a palestra, a cantiga',
    'meio esquecida ecoou na cabeça de Winston.',
    'Laranjas e limões, dizem os sinos de S.',
    'Clemente. Me deves três víntens, dizem',
    'os sinos de S. Martinho! Era curioso, mas',
    'repetindo a letra tinha a ilusão exata',
    'de ouvir sinos, os sinos de uma Londres perdida',
    'que ainda existia nalguma parte, disfarçada',
    'e ,esquecida. De suas tôrres fantasmais',
    'ele parecia ouvi-los bimbalhando. Entretanto,',
    'até onde podia recordar, nunca na vida',
    'ouvira um sino. Despediu-se do sr. Charrington',
    'e desceu a escada sózinho, para que o velho',
    'não o visse examinando a rua antes de sair.',
    'Já resolvera que, depois de um intervalo',
    'apropriado, um mês, por exemplo,, correria',
    'de novo o risco de visitar a loja. Talvez',
    'não fosse mais perigoso do que falhar a',
    'um sarau no Centro. A grande tolíce fora',
    'voltar ali, depois de comprar o diário,',
    'sem saber se o dono da loja merecia confiança.',
    'Contudo. ! Sim, pensou, haveria de voltar.',
    'Compraria novas amostras de linda bobagem.',
    'Compraria a gravura de S. Clemente dos Dinamarqueses,',
    'desemoldurando-a e levando-a para casa escondida',
    'dentro do macacão. Arrancaria da memória',
    'do sr. Charrington o resto da cançoneta.',
    'Até o projeto\'lunático de alugar o quarto',
    'de cima tornou a cintilar no seu juizo. Durante',
    'uns cinco segundos talvez a exaltação',
    'o tornou descuidado e ele pisou a calçada',
    'sem dar uma única espiadela preliminar.',
    'Ia até trauteando, com melodia improvisada',
    'Laranjas e limões, dizem os sinos de S.',
    'Clemente, Me deves três vinténs, dizem',
    'os. De repente o coração pareceu-lhe',
    'gelar no peito, e as tripas derreterem. Uma',
    'pessoa de macacão azul vinha na direção',
    'oposta, a menos de dez metros. Era a morena',
    'do Departamento de Ficção. A luz crepuscular',
    'era pouca, mas suficiente para reconhecê-la.',
    'Ela olhou-o bem no rosto- e continuou como',
    'se não o tivesse visto. Durante uns segundos,',
    'Winston sentiu-se tão paralisado que não',
    'pôde se mexer. Depois virou para a direita',
    'e saiu com passos tardos, sem notar que tomara',
    'a direção errada. De qualquer maneira,',
    'uma questão se esclarecera. Não podia',
    'mais haver dúvida de que a moça o estava',
    'espionando. Devia tê-lo seguido até lá,',
    'porque não era crível que por puro acaso',
    'fosse passear a mesma noite pela mesma ruinha',
    'obscura, a quilômetros de distância de',
    'qualquer bairro habitado por membros do Partido.',
    'Era demasiada coincidência. Pouco importava',
    'que pertencesse à Polícia do Pensamento,',
    'ou que fosse mera espiã amadora, impelida',
    'pelo desejo de fazer média. Provàvelmente,',
    'vira-o também entrar no bar. Andar era',
    'um esfôrço. A cada passo, o pêso de',
    'cristal no bolso lhe batia na coxa, e êIe',
    'teve ganas de jogá-lo fora. O pior de tudo',
    'era a dor de barriga. Durante uns dois minutos,',
    'teve a impressão de que morreria se não',
    'fosse logo à privada. Mas não devia haver',
    'gabinetes públicos num bairro daqueles.',
    'Felizmente, o espasmo passou, deixando em',
    'seu lugar uma dor surda. A rua era um beco',
    'sem saída. Winston parou, ficou uns segundos',
    'pensando no que fazer, depois deu meia-volta',
    'e regressou. Ao se voltar, ocorreu-lhe que',
    'como a moça cruzara por ele uns três',
    'minutos antes, haveria de alcançá-la,',
    'provavelmente. Poderia segui-la até um',
    'lugar ermo, e então esmagalhar-lhe o crânio',
    'com um paralelepípedo. O pêso de papel',
    'seria suficiente para isso. Mas ele abandonou',
    'imediatamente o plano, porque era insuportável',
    'a simples idéia do esfôrço físico.',
    'Não podia correr, não podia desferir',
    'uma Pancada. Além disso, ela era jovem',
    'e vigorosa e certamente se defenderia. Pensou',
    'também em correr ao Centro Comunal e ficar',
    'lá até fechar, de modo a estabelecer',
    'um álibi parcial para a noite. Mas também',
    'isso era impossível. Uma tremenda lassitude',
    'o dominava. O que queria era ir logo para',
    'casa, sentar-se e descansar. Passava das',
    'vinte e duas quando chegou ao apartamento.',
    'As luzes seriam desligadas na chave geral',
    'às vinte e três e trinta. Foi à cozinha',
    'e enguliu uma xícara quase cheia de Gin',
    'Vitória. Foi então à mesa, no nicho',
    'da sala, sentou-se e tirou o diário da',
    'gaveta. Mas não o abriu imediatamente.',
    'Na teletela uma mulher com voz de lata berrava',
    'uma canção patriótica. Ele ficou contemplando',
    'o papel mármore da capa do caderno, tentando',
    'sem êxito banir dos sentidos aquela voz.',
    'Era à noite que vinham buscar a gente,',
    'sempre à noite. O melhor era matar-se antes',
    'de ser apanhado. Sem dúvida havia gente',
    'capaz disso. Com efeito, muitos dos desaparecidos',
    'eram suicidas. Mas era preciso coragem desesperada',
    'para se matar num mundo em que era impossível',
    'obter armas de fogo, ou veneno rápido e',
    'certo. Pensou, com uma espécie de assombro,',
    'na inutilidade biológica da dor e do medo,',
    'na traição do corpo humano que sempre',
    'se congela na inércia, no momento exato',
    'em que dele se exige esfôrço especial.',
    'Poderia ter silenciado a moça morena se',
    'conseguisse agir com rapidez, mas precisamente',
    'por causa do perigo extremo que corria perdera',
    'a capacidade de agir. Ocorreu-lhe que, em',
    'momentos de crise, nunca se luta com um inimigo',
    'externo, mas com o próprio organismo. Mesmo',
    'agora, apesar do gin, a dor surda do ventre',
    'tornava impossível dois pensamentos consecutivos.',
    'E é o mesmo em todas as situações aparentemente',
    'heróicas ou trágicas. No campo de batalha,',
    'na câmara de tortura, num navio que naufraga,',
    'as causas por que lutamos são sempre secundárias,',
    'esquecidas, porque o corpo incha,e se infla',
    'até ocupar todo o universo, e mesmo quando',
    'não nos paralisa o mêdo, nem gritamos',
    'de dor, a vida é uma luta, minuto a minuto,',
    'contra a fome, o frio, a insônia, contra',
    'uma dor de estômago ou de dentes. Abriu',
    'o diário. Era importante escrever alguma',
    'coisa. A mulher da teletela atacara nova',
    'canção. Sua voz parecia ferir-lhe os',
    'miolos como estilhaços irregulares de vidro.',
    'Ele procurou pensar em O\'Brien, para quem,',
    'ou a quem, estava escrevendo o diário,',
    'mas ao invés se pôs a pensar no que lhe',
    'aconteceria quando a Polícia do Pensamento',
    'o levasse. Não fazia diferença, se o',
    'matassem logo. Ser morto era o que esperava.',
    'Mas antes da morte (ninguém falava de tais',
    'coisas, mas todo mundo sabia) havia a rotina',
    'da confissão: rastejar no chão e implorar',
    'misericórdia, o estalo de ossos partidos,',
    'os dedos quebrados e o cabelo com coágulos',
    'de sangue. Por que passar por tudo isso,',
    'se o fim era sempre o mesmo? Por que não',
    'encurtar de alguns dias ou algumas semanas',
    'a vida do sujeito? Ninguém jamais escapava',
    'ao descobrimento, nem ninguém deixava de',
    'confessar. Quando se sucumbia à crimidéia',
    'era certo que em determinada data se estava',
    'morto. Por que então aquele terror fatal',
    'do futuro, que nada alterava? Ele tornou',
    'a tentar, com um pouco mais de êxito, conjurar',
    'a imagem de O\'Brien. "Tornaremos a nos encontrar',
    'onde não há treva," dissera O\'Brien.',
    'Ele sabia o que significavam aquelas palavras,',
    'ou acreditava saber. O lugar onde não havia',
    'trevas era o futuro imaginário, que nunca',
    'se podia ver mas que, pelo pensamento, se',
    'podia partilhar misticamente. Mas com a voz',
    'da tela a lhe azucrinar os ouvidos, não',
    'era possível continuar o fio dos pensamentos.',
    'Pôs um cigarro na boca. Metade do fumo',
    'caiu-lhe na língua, uma poeira amarga difícil',
    'de cuspir. O rosto do Grande Irmão surgiu-lhe',
    'na mente, deslocando o de O\'Brien. Tal como',
    'fizera uns dias antes, tirou um níquel',
    'do bolso e examinou-o. O rosto fitava-o de',
    'frente, pesado, calmo, protetor, mas que',
    'espécie de sorriso se ocultava sob o bigode',
    'negro? Como um dôbre a finados, voltaram-lhe',
    'à mente as palavras: GUERRA é PAZ LIBERDADE',
    'é ESCRAVIDãO IGNORâNCIA é FORçA',
    '9 IA PELA METADE O EXPEDIENTE MATUTINO E',
    'WINSTON SAIRA do cubículo para ir à toilette.',
    'Uma figura solitária caminhava ao seu encontro,',
    'do outro extrêmo do corredor enorme, bem',
    'iluminado. Era a moça do cabelo escuro.',
    'Quatro dias se havíam passado desde o encontro',
    'diante da casa de quinquilharia. Quando se',
    'aproximou, viu que ela trazia o braço direito',
    'na tipóia, que se não distinguia a distância',
    'por ser da mesma cor que o macacão. Certamente',
    'machucara a mão fazendo girar um dos grandes',
    'caleidoscópios nos quais eram "criados"',
    'os enredos das novelas. Era um desastre comum',
    'no Departamento de Ficção. Estavam a',
    'talvez quatro metros de distância quando',
    'a moça tropeçou e caiu de bruços. Soltou',
    'um grito de dor agudo. Devia ter caido sobre',
    'o braço ferido. Winston deteve-se. A moça',
    'levantara-se sobre os joelhos. Seu rosto',
    'estava de cor amarelo-creme, que fazia destacar',
    'a boca, mais vermelha que nunca. Fixava-o',
    'dentro dos olhos, com uma expressão implorante',
    'que parecia mais de medo que de dor. Uma',
    'emoção estranha agitou o coração',
    'de Winston. Diante dele estava um inimigo',
    'que queria matá-lo; mas diante dele, também,',
    'havia uma criatura humana, sofrendo, talvez',
    'com um osso quebrado. Já se adiantara instintivamente',
    'para ajudá-la. No momento em que a vira',
    'cair sobre o braço vendado, sentira como',
    'que uma dor no próprio corpo., Te machucaste?',
    'indagou., Não é nada. Meu braço. Daqui',
    'a um instantinho está bom. Ela falou como',
    'tivesse o coração agitado. Empalidecera',
    'fortemente., Não quebraste nada?, Não,',
    'estou bem. Doeu um pouco, mas já passou.',
    'Deu-lhe a mão livre, e ele ajudou-a a levantar-se.',
    'Ela já recuperara um pouco do seu colorido',
    'e parecia estar melhor., Não é nada',
    '- repetiu., Apenas deu um baque no pulso.',
    'Obrigada, camarada! E com isso continuou',
    'na direção em que ia antes, com o mesmo',
    'passo decidido, como se de fato fosse nada.',
    'O incidente todo mal durara meio minuto.',
    'Nem isso, talvez. Não permitir que os sentimentos',
    'se revelem na fisionomia era um hábito',
    'que adquirira proporções de instinto,',
    'e além disso tudo sucedera diante duma',
    'teletela. Não obstante, fora muito difícil',
    'não trair uma surpresa momentânea, porque',
    'nos dois ou três segundos que estivera',
    'a ajudá-la a moça passara à mão dele',
    'um objeto qualquer. Não havia dúvida',
    'de que o fizera intencionalmente. Era algo',
    'pequeno e chato. Quando entrou no mictório,',
    'ele transferiu o objeto ao bolso e apalpou-o',
    'com as pontas dos dedos. Era um pedaço',
    'de papel, dobrado várias vezes. Parado',
    'diante do vaso ele conseguiu, manobrando',
    'os dedos, desdobrar o papel. Evidentemente,',
    'continha um recado. Por um momento, sentiu-se',
    'tentado a trancar-se na privada e lê-lo',
    'ali mesmo. Mas seria uma estúpida loucura,',
    'como sabia muito bem. Não havia lugar que',
    'as teletelas vigiassem com maior atenção',
    'e continuidade. Voltou ao cubículo, sentou-se,',
    'atirou o fragmento de papel, com toda a naturalidade,',
    'entre outros papéis sobre a escrivaninha,',
    'colocou os óculos e puxou o falascreve',
    'na sua direção. "Cinco minutos", disse',
    'ele consigo mesmo, "cinco minutos no mínimo!"',
    'Dentro do peito o coração lhe martelava',
    'com um barulho de dar medo. Felizmente, estava',
    'ocupado com um trabalho de rotina, mera retificação',
    'de uma lista de cifras, o que não exigia',
    'grande atenção. Fosse o que fosse, devia',
    'ter sentido político a mensagem do papel.',
    'Tanto quanto podia imaginar, só havia duas',
    'possibilidades. Uma, e a mais provável,',
    'era de que a moça fosse agente da Polícia',
    'do Pensamento, como temia. Não sabia por',
    'que a Polícia do Pensamento haveria de',
    'mandar recados daquela maneira, mas devia',
    'ter seus motivos. O que estava escrito no',
    'papel podia ser uma ameaça, uma in- timação,',
    'uma ordem de suicídio, uma armadilha qualquer.',
    'Mas havia outra possibilidade, mais louca,',
    'que insistia em levantar a cabeça, embora',
    'debalde tentasse suprimi-la. Era de a mensagem',
    'vir não da Polícia do Pensamento, mas',
    'de alguma organização clandestina. Talvez',
    'a Fraternidade existisse, afinal de contas!',
    'Talvez a moça fizesse parte dela! Sem dúvida,',
    'a idéia era absurda, mas lhe brotara na',
    'mente no mesmo instante em que sentira o',
    'papel na mão. Só dali a uns dois minutos',
    'foi que a outra explicação mais provável',
    'lhe ocorrera. E mesmo agora, conquanto o',
    'intelecto lhe dissesse que o recado com certeza',
    'significava morte, não era o que ele acreditava,',
    'e a esperança irracional persistia, o coração',
    'tumultuava, e foi com dificuldade que impediu',
    'a voz de tremer ao murmurar os números',
    'dentro do falascreve. Enrolou todos os papéis',
    'da tarefa terminada e meteu o maço no tubo',
    'pneumático. Oito minutos haviam passado.',
    'Reajustou os óculos no nariz, suspirou',
    'e puxou outro maço de papéis, com o recado',
    'em cima. Alisou-o com os dedos. No papel',
    'estava escrito, em caligrafia graúda e',
    'irregular: Eu te amo. Durante vários segundos',
    'ele ficou tão boquiaberto que nem se lembrou',
    'de atirar no buraco da memória o papel',
    'incriminador. Quando afinal o jogou fora,',
    'não pôde resistir a uma segunda leitura,',
    'para se certificar de que eram aquelas as',
    'palavras, embora soubesse muito bem do perigo',
    'que corria em demonstrar demasiado interêsse.',
    'O resto da manhã, foi-lhe muito difícil',
    'trabalhar. Pior que concentrar a mente numa',
    'série de servicinhos insignificantes era',
    'a necessidade de ocultar sua agitação',
    'perante a teletela. Teve a impressão de',
    'que uma fogueira lhe ardia na barriga. Foi',
    'um tormento o almôço na cantina quente,',
    'cheia, ruidosa. Tivera a esperança de ficar',
    'a sós uns minutos, na hora do almôço,',
    'mas por azar o imbecil do Parsons viera sentar-se',
    'ao lado dele, o fedor de suor quase sobrepujando',
    'o cheiro ativo do guisado, e metralhou-o',
    'com uma série de comentários sobre a',
    'Semana do ódio. Estava interessadíssimo',
    'num modêlo, em papier mâché, da cabeça',
    'do Grande Irmão, de dois metros de largura,',
    'que a tropa de Espiões da filha estava',
    'confeccionando para a festa. O mais irritante',
    'era que, em meio à barulhada de vozes,',
    'Winston mal ouvia o que dizia Parsons, e',
    'se via obrigado a pedir-lhe, constantemente,',
    'que repetisse palavras fátuas. Apenas uma',
    'vez entreviu a pequena, do outro lado da',
    'sala, sentada com outras duas. Ela pareceu',
    'não tê-lo visto, e ele não olhou mais',
    'naquela direção. A tarde foi mais suportável.',
    'Logo depois do almôço chegou-lhe às',
    'mãos um serviço delicado, difícil,',
    'que tomou várias horas de pesquisa e exigiu',
    'o abandono de tudo o mais. Consistia da falsificação',
    'de uma série de relatórios de produção,',
    'de dois anos antes, de maneira a desacreditar',
    'um eminente membro do Partido Interno que',
    'estava agora meio comprometido. Era a função',
    'que Winston desempenhava com mais talento,',
    'e durante mais de duas horas conseguiu não',
    'pensar na moça. Depois, a lembrança do',
    'seu rosto voltou e com ela um desejo furioso,',
    'intolerável, de estar só. Seria impossível',
    'pensar na situação enquanto não conseguisse',
    'ficar só. à noite, porém, tinha de',
    'ir ao Centro Comunal. Enguliu outra refeição',
    'sem gôsto na cantina, correu ao Centro,',
    'tomou parte na farça solene de um "grupo',
    'de discussão", jogou duas partidas de pingue-pongue,',
    'tragou vários copos de gin e assistiu uma',
    'conferência de meia-hora, sob o título',
    '"Ingsoc em relação ao xadrez." Sentia',
    'a alma sêca de tanto aborrecimento, mas',
    'não teve impulso de f\'ugir à noitada',
    'no Centro. à vista das palavras Eu te amo',
    'crescera dentro dele o desejo de viver, parecendo-lhe',
    'estúpido assumir riscos miudos. Não foi',
    'senão às vinte e três horas, sózinho',
    'na cama, e no escuro, que era o jeito de',
    'se defender da teletela, contanto que ficasse',
    'quieto, que pôde pensar continuamente.',
    'Era um problema físico que exigia solução:',
    'como entrar em contacto com a moça e combinar',
    'um encontro. Já não considerava a possibilidade',
    'de ser armadilha. Sabia que não era, por',
    'causa da inconfundível agitação da',
    'morena ao lhe entregar o bilhete. Era evidente',
    'que morria de medo, como seria natural. Tampouco',
    'lhe passara pela cabeça a idéia de recusar',
    'a declaração. Cinco noites antes pensara',
    'em esmagar- lhe o crânio com um paralelepípedo;',
    'mas isso não importava. Pensava em seu',
    'corpo nú e jovem, como o vira em sonhos.',
    'Imaginara-a uma tola, como todas as outras,',
    'a cabeça recheada de patranhas e ódio,',
    'a barriga cheia de gelo. Uma espécie',
    'de febre o dominou, ao pensar que Poderia',
    'perdê-la, o corpo jovem e alvo fugindo',
    'dele! O que temia, mais do que qualquer outra',
    'coisa, era que ela mudasse de idéia, se',
    'não fizesse logo por entrar em contacto',
    'com ela. Mas era enorme a dificuldade física',
    'de se encontrarem. Era como mover uma pedra',
    'ao xadrez, depois de ter levado mate. Para',
    'onde quer que se virasse, tinha a teletela',
    'pela frente. Na verdade, todas as maneiras',
    'possíveis de se comunicar com ela lhe haviam',
    'ocorrido nos cinco minutos após ler o recado;',
    'mas agora, com tempo para refletir, examinou-as,',
    'uma a uma, como quem depõe na mesa uma',
    'fila de instrumentos. Evidentemente, não',
    'se podia repetir o encontro havido aquela',
    'manhã. Se ela trabalhasse no Departamento',
    'de Registro, seria relativamente simples,',
    'porém ele tinha idéia muito vaga da localização',
    'do Departamento de Ficção e não havia',
    'pretexto para visitá-lo. Se soubesse onde',
    'morava, e a que hora deixava o trabalho,',
    'poderia dar um jeito para encontrá-la no',
    'caminho de casa. Mas segui-la não era aconselhável,',
    'porque teria que esperar nas imediações',
    'do Ministério, o que certamente seria notado.',
    'Quanto a mandar uma carta pelo correio, era',
    'impossível. Por um processo que nem mesmo',
    'era secreto, todas as cartas eram abertas',
    'em trânsito. Na verdade, pouquíssima',
    'gente escrevia cartas. Quando, ocasionalmente,',
    'havia necessidade de se mandar uma comunicação,',
    'existiam cartões postais impressos com',
    'longas listas de frases, e o cídadão',
    'riscava as que não se aplicavam. Além',
    'do mais, não sabia o nome da moça, e',
    'muito menos o enderêço. Por fim resolveu',
    'que o melhor lugar seria a cantina. Se conseguisse',
    'sentar-se a uma mesa com ela, mais ou menos',
    'no meio da sala, longe das teletelas, e com',
    'suficiente ruido de conversação em tôrno',
    '- e se essas condições durassem uns trinta',
    'segundos, talvez fosse possível trocar',
    'algumas palavras. Durante uma semana, a partir',
    'daquele dia, a vida foi um sonho sem descanso.',
    'No dia seguinte ela não apareceu na cantina',
    'senão quando ele estava de saída, e o',
    'apito já tocara. Com certeza fora transferida',
    'a outra turma. Passaram sem se olhar. No',
    'dia seguinte, ela estava na cantina na hora',
    'do costume, mas com outras três colegas,',
    'e bem debaixo duma teletela. A seguir, por',
    'três dias penosos, não apareceu. O cérebro',
    'e o corpo de Winston pareciam atacados de',
    'intolerável\' sensibilidade, uma espécie',
    'de transparência, que transformava em agonia',
    'qualquer movimento, qualquer som, contacto',
    'ou palavra que tivesse de pronunciar ou ouvir.',
    'Mesmo dormindo não podia fugir-lhe à',
    'imagem. Não tocou o diário. Se alívio',
    'havia, estava no trabalho, no qual às vezes',
    'podia se esquecer do mundo por períodos',
    'de até dez minutos. Não tinha a menor',
    'idéia do que teria acontecido com ela.',
    'Não havia jeito de informar-se. Poderia',
    'ter sido vaporizada, poderia ter-se suicidado,',
    'poderia ter sido transferida a outra parte',
    'da Oceania: o pior, e mais provável, era',
    'que tivesse simplesmente mudado de idéia,',
    'e resolvido evitá-lo. No dia seguinte ela',
    'reapareceu. Já não tinha o braço na',
    'tipóia, porém o pulso ainda estava enrolado',
    'em esparadrapo. O consôlo de revê-la',
    'foi tamanho que não pôde resistir à',
    'tentação de fitá-la durante vários',
    'segundos. No dia seguinte, quase conseguiu',
    'falar-lhe. Ao entrar na cantina, ela já',
    'estava junto duma mesa, longe da parede,',
    'e sózinha. Era cedo, e a sala não estava',
    'cheia. A fila avançou vagarosa até Winston',
    'quase chegar ao balcão. Nesse momento deteve-se',
    'uns dois minutos porque alguém se queixava',
    'de não ter recebido sua pastilha de sacarina.',
    'Mas a jovem ainda estava só quando Winston',
    'tomou a bandeja e se encaminhou para a mesa.',
    'Ia caminhando com naturalidade, fingindo',
    'procurar lugar mais adiante. Estava a três',
    'metros dela, talvez. Mais dois segundos e',
    'pronto. Então uma voz atrás dele chamou',
    '"Smith!" Ele fingiu não ouvir. "Smith!"',
    'repetiu mais alto. Inútil. Voltou-se. Um',
    'moço louro, cara de bobo, chamado Wilsher,',
    'que ele mal conhecia, convidava-o, com um',
    'sorriso, a sentar-se à sua mesa. Não',
    'era seguro recusar. Tendo sido reconhecido,',
    'não podia preferir a mesa da moça sózinha.',
    'Daria na vista. Sentou-se com um sorriso',
    'amável. O rosto louro e tolo correspondeu.',
    'Winston teve uma alucinação em que se',
    'via dando uma machadada bem no meio daquele',
    'sorriso alvar. Uns minutos depois, a mesa',
    'da jovem estava cheia. Ela porém devia',
    'tê-lo visto encaminhar-se na sua direção,',
    'e talvez lhe percebesse o intento. No dia',
    'seguinte, ele procurou chegar cedo. Com efeito,',
    'lá estava ela, numa mesa mais ou menos',
    'no mesmo lugar, e só. A pessoa que o antecedia',
    'na fila era um homenzinho de movimentos rápidos,',
    'feito um besouro, de cara chata e olhos miúdos',
    'e suspicazes. Quando Winston se voltou do',
    'balcão, com a bandeja, viu que o homenzinho',
    'ia reto na direção da mesa da moça.',
    'O coração caiu-lhe aos pés. Havia lugar',
    'numa mesa pouco mais adiante, Porém na',
    'aparência do homem alguma coisa dizia que',
    'amava o próprio confôrto o suficiente',
    'para escolher a mesa mais vazia. Com gelo',
    'no coração, Winston acompanhou-o. Não',
    'adiantaria nada, a menos que pudesse ficar',
    'a sós com ela. Nesse momento houve um baque',
    'tremendo. O homenzinho estava de quatro,',
    'a bandeja voara longe, e dois arroios de',
    'sopa e café corriam pelo soalho. Ele levantou-se',
    'com uma olhada maligna a Winston, de quem',
    'evidentemente desconfiava de o haver derrubado.',
    'Mas nada sucedeu. Cinco segundos depois,',
    'com o coração dando pinotes, Winston',
    'sentava-se à mesa da moça. Não a olhou.',
    'Desocupou a bandeja e começou a comer.',
    'Era importantíssimo falar imediatamente,',
    'antes que viesse alguém. No entanto, um',
    'medo terrível se apossara dele. Uma semana',
    'se passara desde que ela lhe dera o recado.',
    'Talvez tivesse mudado de idéia, com certeza',
    'mudara de idéia! Era impossível que uma',
    'coisa dessas corresse bem; isso não acontece',
    'na vida real. Ele teria calado para sempre',
    'se naquele momento não visse Ampleforth,',
    'o poeta de orelhas peludas, vagando pelo',
    'salão, à procura de um lugar para sentar.',
    'Com seus modos aéreos, Ampleforth tinha',
    'simpatia por Winston, e certamente escolheria',
    'aquela mesa, se o visse. Sobrava-lhe talvez',
    'um minuto. Tanto Winston como a moça comiam',
    'sem parar. Ingeriam sem o menor prazer uma',
    'sopa rala, um caldo de vagens. Muito baixinho,',
    'Winstón pôs-se a falar. Nenhum dos dois',
    'levantou a vista. Metendo colherada após',
    'colherada do liquido na boca, trocaram as',
    'palavras necessárias, num murmurio sem',
    'expressão. A que horas sais do serviço?',
    'Dezoito e trinta. Onde podemos nos encontrar?',
    'Praça da Vitória, perto do monumento.',
    'é cheio de teletelas. Não importa, se',
    'houver povo. Algum sinal? Não. Não te',
    'aproximes, se eu não estiver no meio da',
    'multidão. Não me olhes. Apenas chega',
    'perto., A que horas?, às dezenove. -',
    'Muito bem. Ampleforth não viu Winston e',
    'sentou-se noutra mesa. Não tornaram a falar',
    'e até onde é possível a duas pessoas',
    'sentadas à mesma mesa: uma diante da outra,',
    'não se olharam. A moça terminou o almôço',
    'ràpidamente e se foi, enquanto Winston',
    'fumava um cigarro Vitória. Já antes da',
    'hora marcada, Winston estava na praça.',
    'Deu algumas voltas em tôrno da base da',
    'enorme coluna em gomos, no alto da qual a',
    'estátua do Grande Irmão, voltada para',
    'o sul, fitava os céus onde havia derrotado',
    'os aeroplanos eurasianos (aeroplanos lestasianos,',
    'tinha sido, anos atrás) na batalha da Pista',
    'N.o 1. Na rua, diante da coluna, havia a',
    'estátua de um homem a cavalo que se supunha',
    'representar Oliveiros Cromwell. Cinco minutos',
    'depois da hora a moça ainda não aparecera.',
    'De novo o medo terrível se apossou de Winston.',
    'Ela não viria, mudara de idéia! Encaminhouse',
    'lentamente para a face norte da praça e',
    'com pálido prazer identificou a igreja',
    'de S. Martinho, cujos sinos, quando ainda',
    'tinha sinos, haviam cantado "Me deves três',
    'vintens." Nesse momento, viu a moça junto',
    'à base do monumento, lendo ou fingindo',
    'ler uma proclamação que subia em espiral',
    'pela coluna. Não era seguro aproximar-se',
    'enquanto não se acumulasse mais gente.',
    'Havia teletelas por toda parte. Naquele momento,',
    'porém, elevou-se da esquerda uma gritaria,',
    'acompanhada do barulho de veículos pesados.',
    'De repente, todo mundo pareceu convergir',
    'para um só ponto. A moça deu volta em',
    'tôrno dos leões, na base do monumento,',
    'e juntou-se à massa. Winston seguiu-a.',
    'Enquanto corria percebeu, por uns gritos,',
    'que estava passando um comboio de prisioneiros',
    'eurasianos. Já uma quantidade considerável',
    'de pessoas bloqueava o lado sul da praça.',
    'Winston, que em circunstâncias normais',
    'gravitava para a periferia de qualquer aglomeração,',
    'empurrou, acotovelou, esgueirou-se, tentando',
    'alcançar o meio do povaréu. Dali a pouco',
    'estava a um braço de distância da moça,',
    'mas de permeio havia um enorme prole e uma',
    'mulher quase tão vasta, sua espôsa certamente,',
    'e formavam impenetrável muralha de carne.',
    'Winston forcejou de lado e com um violento',
    'empurrão conseguiu meter o ombro entre',
    'os dois. Por um momento teve a impressão',
    'de que iam esmagar suas entranhas com as',
    'ancas musculosas, mas por fim passou, suando',
    'um pouco. Estava ao lado dela. Os ombros',
    'se tocavam, e ambos fixavam um ponto qualquer,',
    'no meio da rua. Uma longa fila de caminhões,',
    'com guardas de cara de pau, armados de metralhadoras',
    'de mão, e postados em cada canto, ia passando',
    'lentamente. Nos caminhões iam de cócoras,',
    'muito apertados, uns soldadinhos amarelos,',
    'metidos em esfarrapados uniformes verdoengos.',
    'As tristes caras mongólicas olhavam para',
    'fora, sem a menor curiosidade. De vez em',
    'quando, os caminhões davam um tranco e',
    'se ouvia o tilintar de metais: todos os prisioneiros',
    'usavam grilhões. Passaram muitos caminhões',
    'atulhados de caras tristes. Winston sabia',
    'que estavam passando, mas só os via intermitentemente.',
    'O ombro da moça, e o seu braço direito,',
    'até o cotovelo, se comprimiam contra ele.',
    'A face estava tão perto que podia quase',
    'sentir-lhe o calor. Ela assumira imediatamente',
    'o comando da situação, como fizera na',
    'cantina. Pôs-se a falar com a mesma voz',
    'sem expressão que antes, mal mexendo os',
    'lábios, um murmurio que se perdia em meio',
    'ao vozerio e ao estrondo dos caminhões.',
    '- Estás-me ouvindo?, Estou., Estás',
    'livre domingo à tarde?, Estou., Então',
    'escuta com cuidado. Tens de decorar isto.',
    'Vai à estação de Paddington. Com',
    'uma precisão militar que o assombrou, a',
    'moça delineou o itinerário que deveria',
    'seguir. Meia hora de trem. Sair da estação',
    'e encaminhar-se para a esquerda. Dois quilômetros',
    'pela estrada. Uma porteira sem travessão',
    'superior. Um caminho atravessando o campo.',
    'Uma alameda gramada. Uma picada entre touceiras.',
    'Uma árvore morta coberta de musgo. Era',
    'como se tivesse um mapa na cabeça., Lembras',
    'de tudo?, murmurou por fim., Lembro. -',
    'Viras à esquerda, depois à direita, depois',
    'à esquerda outra vez. A porteira sem travessão',
    'de cima., Sim. A que horas?, às quinze,',
    'mais ou menos. Talvez tenhas que esperar.',
    'Chegarei por outro caminho. Decoraste tudo?',
    '- Decorei., Então dá o fora o mais depressa',
    'possível. Não seria preciso dizê-lo.',
    'Mas por um momento não lhes foi possível',
    'livrar-se da multidão. Os caminhões continuavam',
    'passando, e o povo, insaciável, queria',
    'olhar. No comêço algumas vaias e assovios',
    'tinham soado, de membros do Partido ali presentes,',
    'mas não haviam durado muito. A emoção',
    'geral era de simples curiosidade. Estrangeiros,',
    'fossem da Eurásia ou da Lestásia, eram',
    'considerados animais estranhos. Literalmente,',
    'não eram vistos nunca a não ser como',
    'prisioneiros, e mesmo como prisioneiros não',
    'eram vistos senão de relance. Nem se sabia',
    'o que lhes acontecia, além de alguns enforcados',
    'como criminosos de guerra: os outros desapareciam,',
    'presumivelmente em campos de trabalhos forçados.',
    'Aos rostos redondos dos mongóis se haviam',
    'sucedido faces de tipo mais europeu, sujas,',
    'barbudas e exaustas, de zigomas salientes.',
    'Seus olhos às vezes fitavam os de Winston,',
    'com estranha intensidade, e se afastavam.',
    'O comboio terminava. No último caminhão',
    'vinha um velho, o rosto coberto de cabelo',
    'grisalho desgrenhado, viajando de pé com',
    'os punhos juntos cruzados diante do peito,',
    'como se estivesse acostumado a algemas. Era',
    'quase chegado o momento dos dois se separarem.',
    'Mas no último instante, quando a multidão',
    'ainda os prendia, a mão da moça procurou',
    'a de Winston e apertou-a ligeiramente. O',
    'aperto de mão não durou nem dez segundos',
    'e no entanto pareceu que as mãos tinham',
    'estado juntas longo tempo. Ele teve tempo',
    'de aprender todos os detalhes daquela mão.',
    'Explorou os longos dedos afuselados, as unhas',
    'bem feitas, a palma calejada pelo trabalho',
    'duro, a carne macia do pulso. Decorou-a pelo',
    'tato e soube que a reconheceria se a visse.',
    'No mesmo instante ocorreu-lhe que ainda não',
    'sabia a cor dos olhos da moça. Deviam ser',
    'castanhos, mas não raro gente de cabelo',
    'escuro tem olhos azuis. Voltar a cabeça',
    'e olhá-la seria uma loucura inconcebível.',
    'Com as mãos se apertando, invisíveis',
    'em meio aos corpos, os dois olhavam firmes',
    'para a frente, e ao invés dos da jovem,',
    'os olhos do velho prisioneiro fitaram melancólicamente',
    'Winston por entre as grenhas de cabelo encanecido.',
    '10 Winston ia caminhando pela alameda pintalgada',
    'de luz e sombra, banhando-se em lagos dourados',
    'sempre que os ramos se separavam. Debaixo',
    'das árvores, à esquerda, o chão era',
    'um mar de campânulas. O ar parecia beijar-lhe',
    'a pele. Era dois de maio. Do meio do bosque',
    'se ouvia o arrulhar dos pombos bravos. Ainda',
    'era cêdo. A viagem não oferecera impecilhos,',
    'e a moça tinha tanta experiência, evidentemente,',
    'que Winston sentia menos medo do que sentiria,',
    'em circunstâncias normais. Presumivelmente',
    'ela saberia achar um lugar seguro. Em geral,',
    'não se podia imaginar maior segurança',
    'no campo do que em Londres. Não havia teletelas,',
    'naturalmente, mas havia sempre o perigo de',
    'microfones ocultos, que captavam as vozes',
    'e reconheciam os transviados; além disso,',
    'não era fácíl viajar só sem atrair',
    'a atenção. Para distâncias inferiores',
    'a cem quilônetros não havia necessidade',
    'de carimbar o passaporte, mas às vezes',
    'havia patrulhas nas estações, examinando',
    'os papéis de todos os membros do Partido',
    'que por acaso encontrassem, e fazendo perguntas',
    'indiscretas. Todavia, nenhuma patrulha aparecera,',
    'e afastando-se da estação ele verificara,',
    'olhando para trás com freqüência, que',
    'ninguém o seguia. O trem estava cheio de',
    'proles, alegres e festivos por causa do calor.',
    'O vagão de bancos de pau em que viajou',
    'estava completamente tomado por uma família',
    'só, enorme, desde a bisavó banguela até',
    'um nenê de um mês, a caminho de uma visita',
    'aos parentes do interior e, como explicaram',
    'sem cerimoniosamente a Winston, da compra',
    'de um pouco de manteiga no mercado negro.',
    'A alameda alargou-se e dali a um minuto ele',
    'chegou à picada de que ela lhe falara,',
    'um simples atalho de gado, que mergulhava',
    'entre as touceiras. Não tinha relógio,',
    'mas não deviam ser ainda quinze horas.',
    'As campânulas eram tantas que não podia',
    'caminhar sem pisá-las. Ajoelhou-se e pôs-se',
    'a colher algumas, em parte para matar o tempo,',
    'mas em parte também pela vaga idéia de',
    'que seria agradável ter um ramo de flores',
    'para dar à moça quando aparecesse. Já',
    'reunira um maço regular, e estava sentindo',
    'o aroma um tanto enjoativo quando um ruido',
    'o fez gelar: era o estalido inconfundível',
    'de um pé quebrando um ramo. Continuou colhendo',
    'flores. Era o que melhor tinha a fazer. Podia',
    'ser a pequena, mas podia ser outra pessoa.',
    'Voltar-se seria acusar-se. Colheu mais uma',
    'e mais outra campânula. De repente sentiu',
    'uma mão no ombro. Olhou para cima. Era',
    'a moça. Ela abanou a cabeça, num sinal',
    'evidente de que devia ficar quieto. Depois',
    'separou as touceiras e tomou a frente, seguindo',
    'a picada no rumo do bosque. Era claro que',
    'ali estivera antes, pois evitava os trechos',
    'pantanosos como quem conhece o chão. Winston',
    'seguiu- a, ainda com o ramo de flores na',
    'mão. Sua primeira sensação foi de alívio',
    'mas, olhando o corpo forte e esguio à sua',
    'frente, com a faixa rubra apertada, que ressaltava',
    'a curva dos quadris, começou a pesar-lhe',
    'a própria inferioridade. Mesmo agora ainda',
    'lhe parecia perfeitamente possível que',
    'ela se voltasse, lhe desse uma olhada e se',
    'afastasse. Winston estava embriagado pela',
    'doçura do ar e o verdor das folhas. Já',
    'na caminhada da estação, à luz do sol',
    'de maio, se sentira sujo e estiolado, uma',
    'criatura de quatro paredes, com os poros',
    'entupidos do pó fuliginoso de Londres.',
    'Ocorreu-lhe que até aquele momento ela',
    'provavelmente não o vira à plena luz',
    'do dia. Chegaram à árvore caida de que',
    'ela havia falado. A moça saltou sobre o',
    'tronco e forcejou abrindo uma touceira, num',
    'lugar onde não parecia haver caminho. Quando',
    'Winston a seguiu, achou-se numa clareira',
    'natural, um pequeno recôndito atapetado',
    'de relva e completamente cercado de altos',
    'freixos novos, como uma parede. A moça',
    'parou e voltou-se., Aqui estamos,, anunciou.',
    'Os dois se entreolharam, a vários passos',
    'de distância. Winston ainda não tivera',
    'coragem de se aproximar., Não quis dizer',
    'nada na alameda, continuou ela -porque podia',
    'ser que houvesse um micro escondido. Não',
    'creio que haja, mas pode haver. E aqueles',
    'suinos são bem capazes de reconhecer a',
    'voz da gente. Aqui não há perigo. Ele',
    'continuou sem coragem de se aproximar. -',
    'Não há perigo?, indagou, estupidamente.',
    '- Não. Olha as árvores., Eram freixos',
    'pequenos, que tinham sido podados e haviam',
    'brotado de novo, formando uma floresta de',
    'ramos, nenhum dos quais mais grosso que um',
    'punho., Não há lugar para se esconder',
    'um micro. E eu já estive aqui antes. Estavam',
    'apenas conversando. Winston conseguira achegar-se',
    'um pouco. Ela estava parada diante dele,',
    'muito tesa, tendo nos lábios um sorriso',
    'que parecia irônico, como se admirada de',
    'que levasse tanto tempo para agir. As campânulas',
    'tinham caido ao chão, em cascata. Pareciam',
    'ter caído por si próprias. Ele segurou-lhe',
    'a mão., Acredítas, disse, que até',
    'agora não sabia a cor dos teus olhos? -',
    'Eram castanhos, notou, um castanho bastante',
    'claro, com cílios escuros., Agora que',
    'viste direito como sou, ainda agüentas',
    'me olhar?, Fàcilmente., Tenho trinta',
    'e nove anos. Tenho uma espôsa de que não',
    'me posso livrar. Tenho varizes. E cinco dentes',
    'postiços., Pouco me importa. No momento',
    'seguinte, ela estava nos seus braços, sem',
    'que fosse possivel dizer por iniciativa de',
    'quem. No comêço não sentiu senão',
    'a mais completa incredulidade. O corpo moço',
    'apertado contra o seu, a massa de cabelo',
    'escuro tocando-lhe a face e. sim! ela virou',
    'o rosto e ele beijou a boca grande e vermelha.',
    'Ela passara-lhe os braços pelo pescoço,',
    'e o chamava de querido, amado, bem amado.',
    'Winston puxouw-a para o chão, e ela não',
    'resistiu permitindo-lhe que fizesse o que',
    'bem entendesse. Mas a verdade é que não',
    'tinha outra sensação física, exceto',
    'a do mero contacto. Sentia-se incrédulo',
    'e orgulhoso. Estava satisfeito daquilo acontecer,',
    'mas não tinha desejo físico., Era cedo',
    'demais, a juventude e a boniteza o haviam',
    'amedrontado, ele estava muito acostumado',
    'a viver sem mulher. não sabia por que',
    'razão. A moça ergueu- se um pouco e tirou',
    'uma campânula dos cabelos. E sentou-se,',
    'encostada nêle, passando um braço por',
    'sua cintura., Não tem importância, querido.',
    'Não há pressa. Temos a tarde inteira.',
    'êste esconderijo não é esplêndido?',
    'Encontrei-o uma vez que me perdi num passeio',
    'coletivo. Pode-se ouvir uma pessoa se aproximar',
    'a cem metros de distância., Como te chamas?',
    '- perguntou Winston., Júlia. Eu sei o',
    'teu nome. é Winston. Winston Smith. -',
    'Como descobriste?, Creio que tenho mais',
    'jeito de descobrir as coisas. Diz-me, que',
    'achavas de mim antes do dia em que te dei',
    'o recado? Ele não se sentiu tentado a mentir-lhe.',
    'Seria uma espécie de sacrifício amoroso',
    'contar-lhe tudo., Eu te odiava, disse.',
    '- Queria te violar e depois te assassinar.',
    'Há duas semanas, pensei muito a sério',
    'em te esmagar a cabeça com uma pedra. Se',
    'queres saber, imaginei que fosses da Polícia',
    'do Pensamento. A moça riu-se com gôzo,',
    'evidentemente interpretando aquelas palavras',
    'como um tributo à excelência do seu disfarce.',
    '- Da Polícia do Pensamento? Pensaste mesmo',
    'isso?, Bem, talvez não, exatamente. Mas',
    'pelo teu aspecto geral . apenas porque',
    'és jovem, fresca e sadia, compreendes .',
    'pensei que provavelmente., Pensaste que',
    'eu fosse boa militante. Pura de palavras',
    'e atos. Faixas, passeatas, palavras de ordem,',
    'jogos, piqueniques comunais. toda a tralha.',
    'E achaste que se eu tivesse uma pequena oportunidade',
    'havia de te denunciar como ideocriminoso',
    'e levar-te à morte?, Sim, algo parecido.',
    'Há muitas raparigas assim, sabes, não',
    'é?, é esta porcaria que dá essa impressão',
    '- disse ela, arrancando a faixa escarlate',
    'da Liga Juvenil Anti-Sexo e atirando-a a',
    'uma ramagem. Daí, como se o gesto lhe recordasse',
    'algo, apalpou o bolso do macacão e tirou',
    'uma barra de chocolate. Quebrou-a pela metade',
    'e deu um dos pedaços a Winston. Antes mesmo',
    'de pegá-lo ele sentiu, pelo cheiro, que',
    'se tratava de chocolate fora do comum. Era',
    'escuro e brilhante, e envolto em papel prateado.',
    'Em geral o chocolate era pardo-fosco, quebradiço,',
    'com gôsto de fumaça de lixo. Ele porém',
    'já havia provado chocolate daqueles. O',
    'Perfume adocicado despertara-lhe recordações',
    'que não podia precisar, mas que eram poderosas',
    'e perturbadoras., Onde arranjaste isto?',
    '- No mercado negro, ela respondeu, indiferente.',
    '-Na verdade, externamente eu sou assim. Destaco-me',
    'nos jogos. Fui chefe de tropa nos Espiões,',
    'faço trabalho voluntário três noites',
    'por semana na Liga Juvenil Antí-Sexo. Passei',
    'horas e horas grudando sandices pelas paredes',
    'de Londres. Sempre levo uma ponta de faixa',
    'nas passeatas. Estou sempre de cara alegre',
    'e nunca tiro o corpo de nada. Grita sempre',
    'com a massa, digo eu. é o único jeito',
    'de não correr perigo. O primeiro fragmento',
    'de chocolate derretera-se na língua de',
    'Winston. Delicioso! Mas aínda revoluteava',
    'pela periferia da sua consciência aquela',
    'recordação, algo que podia sentir mas',
    'não reduzir a uma forma definida, como',
    'um objeto visto com o rabo do ôlho. Empurrou-a',
    'para longe, sabendo apenas que se tratava',
    'da lembrança de algum ato que gostaria',
    'de desfazer mas não podia., és muito',
    'moça, disse., Uns dez ou quinze anos',
    'mais moça que eu. Que foi que viste em',
    'mim para te atrair?, Alguma coisa na tua',
    'cara. Achei que devia me arriscar. Tenho',
    'jeito para descobrir gente que não se adapta.',
    'Assim que te vi achei que eras contra eles.',
    '. eles, aparentemente, eram o Partido,',
    'e principalmente o Partido Interno, a respeito',
    'do qual falava com ódio e desdém manifestos,',
    'a ponto de arrepiar Winston, embora soubesse',
    'estarem em segurança, se é que podiam',
    'estar em segurança nalguma parte. Outra',
    'coisa que o surpreendera fora a linguagem',
    'forte que usava. Não era recomendável',
    'dizer nomes feios, sendo-se membro do Partido,',
    'e Winston raramente xingava, pelo menos em',
    'voz alta. Júlia, entretanto, parecia incapaz',
    'de mencionar o Partido, especialmente o Partido',
    'Interno, sem usar os palavrões que se vêem',
    'escritos a gis e a carvão em certas ruas',
    'escuras. Não lhe desagradava que assim',
    'fosse: era apenas um sintoma da revolta de',
    'Júlia contra o Partido e seus métodos,',
    'e lhe parecia natural e saudável, como',
    'o espirro de um cavalo que fareja feno podre.',
    'Tinham saído da clareira e vagueavam outra',
    'vez pela alameda pintalgada, com os braços',
    'passados pela cintura, sempre que o caminho',
    'permitisse a passagem de dois. Ele observou',
    'que a cintura dela parecia muito mais maleável',
    'sem a faixa odiosa. Falavam em cochichos.',
    'Fora da clareira, dissera Júlia, era melhor',
    'ficarem quietinhos. Dali a pouco chegaram',
    'ao fim do bosquete. Ela o deteve. é melhor',
    'pararmos aqui. Pode haver alguém vigiando.',
    'Não corremos perigo enquanto ficarmos por',
    'trás das ramadas. Estavam na sombra de',
    'umas aveleiras. O sol, filtrando-se por entre',
    'as folhas inúmeras, ainda lhes ardia no',
    'rosto. Winston olhou para o campo e sofreu',
    'um choque, lento e curioso, de reconhecimento.',
    'Conhecia-o de vista. Um pasto velho, no restôlho,',
    'com um caminho que serpeava de um lado a',
    'outro, pontilhado de cupins. Na sebe irregular,',
    'do lado oposto, os ramos dos ulmeiros balouçavam',
    'de leve na brisa, e suas folhas palpitavam',
    'em densas massas, como cabelo de mulher.',
    'Devia haver por aqui, embora não pudesse',
    'vê-lo, um regato com espraiados verdes',
    'onde nadavam mugens., Não há um regato',
    'por aqui?, sussurrou., Há, sim. Fica',
    'na beirada do outro campo. Tem peixes, uns',
    'peixes grandes. Podes vê-los nadando nas',
    'lagoas, sob os chorões, abanando a cauda.',
    '- é a Terra Dourada. quase, murmurou',
    'ele., Terra Dourada?, Não é nada. Uma',
    'paisagem que às vezes vejo em sonhos. -',
    'Olha!, cochichou Júlia. Um tordo pousára',
    'num ramo, a menos de cinco metros de distância,',
    'quase na altura do rosto dos dois. Era possível',
    'que não os tivesse visto. Estava ao sol,',
    'e eles na sombra. Estirou as asas, tornou',
    'a fechá-las cuidadosamente, inclinou a',
    'cabeça por um instante, como que saudando',
    'o sol, e desencadeou uma torrente sonora.',
    'Dentro do silêncio da tarde era pasmoso',
    'o volume de som. Winston e Júlia deixaram-se',
    'ficar, muito juntos, imóveis, fascinados.',
    'A música continuou, minuto após minuto,',
    'com assombrosas variações, sem nunca',
    'se repetir, quase como se o pássaro estivesse',
    'a exibir, de propósito, o seu virtuosismo.',
    'às vezes parava por alguns segundos, abria',
    'e fechava as asas, depois inflava o peito',
    'malhado e tornava a romper na cantoria. Winston',
    'observava-o com um ar de vaga reverência.',
    'Para quem, para o que, estaria o tordo cantando?',
    'Não havia nem companheira nem rival à',
    'vista. Que é que o fazia pousar num campo',
    'deserto e soltar sua música no vazio? Winston',
    'indagou de si mesmo se, apesar de tudo, não',
    'haveria por perto um microfone escondido.',
    'Ele e Júlia tinham falado em sussurros,',
    'e o micro não poderia tê-los percebido,',
    'mas com certeza captaria o canto do tordo.',
    'Talvez, na ponta do fio, um homenzinho com',
    'cara de besouro escutasse atento, escutasse',
    'canto. Aos poucos, porém, o embevecimento',
    'da música repeliu da mente de Winston todas',
    'as especulações. Era uma espécie de',
    'bálsamo despejado por cima de todo seu',
    'corpo, misturado com os raios do sol que',
    'se filtravam por entre as folhas. Parou de',
    'pensar, ficou apenas sentindo. No seu braço,',
    'a cintura da moça era morna e macia. Atraiu-a',
    'para mais perto, de modo a senti-la junto',
    'ao peito; o corpo de Júlia parecia derreter-se',
    'no dele. Onde quer que o tocasse com as mãos,',
    'cedia como água. As bocas estavam presas;',
    'muito diferente dos beijos quase formais',
    'que haviam trocado antes. Quando separaram',
    'o rosto, os dois suspiraram profundamente.',
    'O passarinho assustou-se e esvoaçou, fugindo.',
    'Winston aproximou os lábios da orelha dela.',
    '- Agora, sussurrou., Aqui não, foi a',
    'resposta., Vamos voltar para o esconderijo.',
    'é mais seguro. Ràpidamente, quebrando',
    'aqui e ali uns ramos secos, os dois voltaram',
    'para a clarêira. Quando mais uma vez se',
    'encontraram na segurança da muralha de',
    'árvores novas, Júlia voltou-se e parou',
    'diante dele. Ambos ofegavam, mas o sorriso',
    'reapareceu nas comissuras dos lábios. Ela',
    'o fitou durante um instante, e depois apalpou',
    'o zip do macacão. Ah, sim! Foi quase como',
    'no sonho de Winston. Quase com a mesma ligeireza,',
    'ela tirou a roupa, e quando a atirou para',
    'um lado foi com o mesmo gesto magnífico',
    'que parecia aniquilar toda uma civilização.',
    'O corpo muito branco lampejou ao sol. Mas,',
    'por um momento, ele não o olhou. Tinha',
    'os olhos grudados na face sardenta, no leve',
    'sorriso de ousadia. Ajoelhou-se diante dela',
    'e tomou-lhe as mãos., Já fizeste isto',
    'antes?, Naturalmente. Centenas de vezes.',
    'quer dizer, muitíssimas vezes., Com membros',
    'do Partido?, Sempre com membros do Partido.',
    '- Do Partido Interno?, Não, com aqueles',
    'porcos, não. Mas há uma porção que',
    'gostaria de fazer uma fèzinha, se tivesse',
    'oportunidade. Não são tão santos quanto',
    'pretendem. O coração dele deu um pincho.',
    'Muitíssimas vezes, dissera ela. Oxalá',
    'tivessem sido centenas. milhares. Tudo',
    'quanto cheirasse a corrupção o enchia',
    'sempre de ardentes esperanças. Quem poderia',
    'saber? O Partido talvez estivesse podre sob',
    'a crosta superior; seu culto da severidade',
    'é a auto-negação podiam ser apenas',
    'uma máscara da iniquidade. Se pudesse infeccioná-los',
    'todos com lepra ou sífilis, com que prazer',
    'o faria! Tudo que servisse para apodrecer,',
    'debilitar, minar! Ele puxou-a para baixo,',
    'fê-la ajoelhar-se à sua frente., Escuta.',
    'Quantos mais homens tiveste, mais te quero.',
    'Compreendes?, Perfeitamente., Odeio a pureza,',
    'odeio a virtude. Não quero que exista virtude',
    'alguma, em parte nenhuma. Quero que todos',
    'sejam corruptos até os ossos., Então',
    'eu sirvo, querido.\' Sou corrupta até os',
    'ossos., Gostas de fazer isto? Não me refiro',
    'a mim, sómente. Gostas da coisa em si?',
    '- Adoro! Acima de tudo, era o que ele desejava',
    'ouvir. Não sómente o amor de uma pessoa,',
    'mas o instinto animal, o desejo simples,',
    'indiscriminado; era a fôrça que faria',
    'a derrocada do Partido. Apertou-a contra',
    'o chão, esmagando campanulas. Desta vez',
    'não houve impecilho. Dentro de alguns instantes,',
    'o ofegar do peito de ambos voltou ao normal,',
    'e com um agradável torpor, cairam separados.',
    'O sol parecia ter esquentado mais. Ambos',
    'tinham sono. Ele puxou o macacão abandonado',
    'e cobriu-a um pouco. Quase imediatamente',
    'cairam no sono e dormiram cerca de meia-hora.',
    'Winston acordou primeiro. Sentou-se e ficou',
    'contemplando a face sardenta, ainda adormecida,',
    'apoiada na palma da mão. Com exceção',
    'da boca, Júlia não podia ser considerada',
    'bonita. Olhando-se de perto, descobria-se',
    'uma ruga ou duas perto dos olhos. O cabelo',
    'escuro e curto era extraordinariamente espesso',
    'e macio. Winston raciocinou que ainda não',
    'sabia todo o nome dela, e onde morava. Aquele',
    'corpo jovem e forte, agora completamente',
    'desprotegido, provocou nele uma sensação',
    'de pena, e proteção. Mas não voltou',
    'de todo a ternura fisica, orgânica, que',
    'sentira sob a aveleira, enquanto cantava',
    'o tordo. Puxou o macacão de lado e estudou',
    'a pele branca e macia. Antigamente, pensou',
    'ele, um homem olhava um corpo de mulher,',
    'via que era desejável e pronto. Mas agora',
    'não era possível ter amor puro, ou pura',
    'lascívia. Não havia mais emoção pura;',
    'estava tudo misturado com medo e ódio.',
    'A união fora uma batalha, o clímax uma',
    'vitória. Era um golpe desferido no Partido.',
    'Era um ato político. 11, Podemos voltar',
    'aqui, disse Júlia., Em geral, não há',
    'perigo em usar duas vezes o mesmo esconderijo.',
    'Mas só daqui a um mês ou dois, claro.',
    'Assim que despertara, mudara totalmente sua',
    'conduta. Tornou- se alerta e prática, vestiu-se,',
    'ajustou na cintura a faixa escarlate, e pôs-se',
    'a organizar os detalhes da viagem de regresso.',
    'A Winston pareceu natural deixar-lhe a iniciativa.',
    'Evidentemente, Júlia tinha uma dose de',
    'manha prática de que ele carecia, e parecia',
    'também ter conhecimento exaustivo dos arredores',
    'de Londres, fruto de inúmeros passeios',
    'comunais. O itinerário que ela lhe sugeriu',
    'diferia bastante do que usara antes, e levava-o',
    'a outra estação., Nunca vás para casa',
    'pelo mesmo caminho que vieste- aconselhou,',
    'com ar de quem anuncia um importante princípio',
    'geral. Iria primeiro, e Winston esperaria',
    'meia-hora, antes de tomar o rumo de volta.',
    'Disse o nome dum lugar onde poderiam se encontrar',
    'depois do trabalho, dali a quatro dias. Era',
    'uma rua de bairro pobre, onde havia uma feira',
    'geralmente cheia de gente ruidosa. Ela fingiria',
    'procurar algo nas barracas, como se quisesse',
    'comprar atacadores de sapato ou linha de',
    'coser. Se achasse não haver perigo, assoaria',
    'o nariz quando ele se aproximasse; senão,',
    'deveria passar sem reconhecê-la. Com sorte,',
    'porém, não haveria risco em conversarem',
    'um quarto de hora no meio da multidão combinando',
    'outro encontro., E agora preciso ir embora',
    '- disse ela, assim que ele decorou as instruções.',
    '- Devo voltar às dezenove e trinta. Tenho',
    'de trabalhar duas horas para a Liga Juvenil',
    'Anti-Sexo, distribuindo volantes, ou algo',
    'parecido. Não é horroroso? Queres me',
    'dar uma escovadela, por favor? Tenho alguma',
    'folha ou raminho no cabelo? Tens certeza?',
    'Então, adeus, meu amor, adeus! Atirou-se',
    'nos braços dele, beijou-o quase com violência,',
    'e dali a um momento abriu caminho entre as',
    'árvores, desaparecendo no bosque com barulho',
    'mínimo. Winston continuava sem saber-lhe',
    'o nome nem o endereço. Não fazia diferença,',
    'porém, pois era inconcebível que pudessem',
    'se encontrar num recinto fechado, ou trocar',
    'qualquer comunicação escrita. Aconteceu',
    'porém que nunca voltaram à clareira do',
    'bosque. Durante o mês de maio só houve',
    'outra ocasião em que conseguiram ficar',
    'sós algum tempo. Foi noutro esconderijo',
    'conhecido de Júlia, o campanário de uma',
    'igreja arruinada, local quase deserto onde',
    'uma bomba atômica caira trinta anos antes.',
    'Era bom lugar para se esconder, mas o perigo',
    'era chegar até lá. O resto do tempo só',
    'podiam se encontrar nas ruas, cada vez num',
    'lugar diferente, e nunca durante mais de',
    'meia-hora. Na rua, em geral era possível',
    'conversar, de certo modo. Vagueando pelas',
    'calçadas cheias de gente, sem ser lado',
    'a lado, e nunca se entreolhando, tinham palestras',
    'curiosas, intermitentes, que sumiam e reapareciam',
    'como os fachos de um farol, súbitamente',
    'silenciadas pela aproximação de um uniforme',
    'do partido ou a proximidade de uma teletela,',
    'e reiniciadas, minutos mais tarde, no meio',
    'duma frase, ou então cortadas ex-abrupto',
    'quando se separavam num ponto combinado,',
    'e continuadas quase sem introdução no',
    'dia seguinte. Júlia parecia bastante acostumada',
    'a esta espécie de conversa, a que chamava',
    '"falar a prestações." Tinha também',
    'uma surpreendente habilidade de falar sem',
    'mexer os lábios. Apenas uma vez, em quase',
    'um mês de encontros noturnos, conseguiram',
    'trocar um beijo. Iam passando em silêncio',
    'por uma rua lateral (Júlia nunca falava',
    'quando estavam longe das artérias principais)',
    'quando se ouviu um ribombo ensurdecedor;',
    'a terra tremeu e o ar se escureceu. Winston',
    'achou-se caído de lado, com escoriações',
    'e muito medo. Uma bomba-foguete devia ter',
    'caído bem perto. De repente viu o rosto',
    'de Júlia, a alguns centímetros do seu,',
    'branca de morte, branca como gis. Até os',
    'lábios tinham perdido a cor. Estava morta!',
    'Apertou-a contra o peito e sentiu que estava',
    'beijando um rosto vivo e palpitante. Aquela',
    'brancura toda era dum pó que caira em cima',
    'dos dois. A face de ambos fora coberta de',
    'forte camada de caliça. Havia noites em',
    'que, chegados ao ponto de encontro, tinham',
    'de passar um pelo outro sem dar sinal de',
    'vida, por causa de alguma patrulha à vista,',
    'ou de um helicóptero pairando por perto.',
    'Mesmo que fosse menos perigoso, seria difícil',
    'encontrar tempo para se encontrar. A semana',
    'de trabalho de Winston era de sessenta horas,',
    'e a de Júlia ainda mais longa, e os dias',
    'de folga variavam conforme a pressão do',
    'serviço, nem sempre coincidindo. E Júlia',
    'raro tinha uma noite inteiramente livre.',
    'Perdia um tempo fabuloso, assistindo conferências',
    'e demonstrações, distribuindo literatura',
    'da Liga Juvenil Anti-Sexo, preparando faixas',
    'para a Semana do ódio, cobrando contribuições',
    'da campanha de poupança, e atividades similares.',
    'Valia a pena, dizia ela; era camuflagem.',
    'Respeitando as leis menores podia infringir',
    'as maiores. Chegou mesmo a induzir Winston',
    'a hipotecar mais uma noite, oferecendo-se',
    'para trabalhar numa fábrica de munições,',
    'nas horas vagas, o que faziam voluntàriamente',
    'todos os zelosos militantes. Assim, uma noite',
    'por semana, Winston passava quatro horas',
    'de paralisante chatice, atarrachando e montando',
    'pedacinhos de metal, provavelmente partes',
    'de fusiveis de bomba, numa oficina mal iluminada',
    'e ventilada onde o bater dos martelos se',
    'misturava penosamente com a música das',
    'teletelas. Quando se encontraram na tôrre',
    'da igreja, foram preenchidos os claros da',
    'sua conversação fragmentada. Era uma',
    'tarde sufocante. No quartinho em cima do',
    'compartimento dos sinos, o ar era quente',
    'e estagnado, e havia um cheiro horrível',
    'de guano de pombo. Passaram horas conversando,',
    'sentados no soalho empoeirado, coberto de',
    'detritos. De vez em quando um deles se levantava',
    'para espiar pelas seteiras, verificar que',
    'não vinha ninguém. Júlia tinha vinte',
    'e seis anos de idade. Morava numa hospedaria',
    'com outras trinta moças ("Sempre o mau',
    'cheiro das mulheres! Como eu odeio as mulheres!"',
    'exclamava, entre parênteses), e trabalhava,',
    'como ele imaginara, nas máquinas novelizadoras',
    'do Departamento de Ficção. Apreciava',
    'o trabalho, que consistia principalmente',
    'em fazer funcionar e manter em bom estado',
    'um poderoso e complicado motor elétrico.',
    'Era "inesperta" porém gostava de usar as',
    'mãos e sentia-se à vontade com maquinaria.',
    'Sabia descrever todo o processo de composição',
    'de um romance, desde a diretriz geral traçada',
    'pelo Comité de Planejamento até os retoques',
    'finais, pelo Esquadrão de Reescritores.',
    'Ela, porém, não se interessava pelo produto',
    'acabado. "Não tínha gôsto pela leitura,"',
    'disse. Para ela, os livros não passavam',
    'de artigos que tinham de ser produzidos,',
    'como botinas ou compotas. Não se recordava',
    'de coisa alguma antes de 1960, e a única',
    'pessoa que conhecera e falava frequentemente',
    'dos dias anteriores à Revolução era',
    'um avô, que desaparecera quando Júlia',
    'tinha oito anos. Na escola, capitaneara o',
    'time de hóquei e dois anos consecutivos',
    'ganhára o troféu de ginástica. Fora',
    'chefe de tropa nos Espiões e secretária',
    'distrital da Liga da Juventude antes de entrar',
    'para a Liga Juvenil Anti-Sexo. Sempre se',
    'demonstrara excelente cidadã. Até fora',
    '(sinal infalível de boa reputação)',
    'escolhida para trabalhar na Pornosec, a sub-secção',
    'do Departamento de Ficção que produzia',
    'pornografia barata para distribuição',
    'entre os proles. Os que lá trabalhavam',
    'lhe davam o apelido de Casa da Lama, observou',
    'ela. Ali permanecera um ano, ajudando a produzir',
    'livretos em envoltórios fechados, com títulos',
    'tais como Contos da Chibata ou Uma Noite',
    'Num Internato de Moças, comprados furtivamente',
    'por jovens proles, que tinham a impressão',
    'de adquirir algo ilegal., Como são êsses',
    'livros?, indagou Winston, curioso., Oh,',
    'droga horrorosa. São chatíssimos. Só',
    'têm seis enredos, que são misturados',
    'e adaptados. Naturalmente eu só estava',
    'nos caleidoscópios. Nunca estive no Esquadrão',
    'de Reescritores. Não sou literata, meu',
    'caro. nem sirvo para isso. Winston soube,',
    'estarrecido, que todos os trabalhadores da',
    'Pornosec eram moças, à exceção do',
    'chefe. A teoria era de que os homens, cujos',
    'instintos sexuais são menos controláveis',
    'que os das mulheres, corriam maior risco',
    'de ser contaminados pela imundície que',
    'lhes passava pelas mãos., Nem gostam de',
    'mulheres casadas, acrescentou., As pequenas',
    'são consideradas sempre tão puras! Eu',
    'pelo menos não sou. Tivera o seu primeiro',
    'caso amoroso aos dezesseis anos, com um militante',
    'de sessenta, que depois se suicidara para',
    'fugir à prisão., E fez muito bem, comentou',
    'Júlia, porque senão haveriam de descobrir',
    'meu nome, quando ele confessasse., Depois',
    'daquele houvera muitos outros. Aos seus olhos,',
    'a vida era muito simples. Queria divertir-se;',
    '"eles", isto é, o Partido, não queriam',
    'deixá-la; porisso infringia a lei da melhor',
    'maneira possível. Parecia achar igualmente',
    'natural que "eles" quisessem proibir os',
    'prazeres e que os cidadãos buscassem fugir',
    'à prisão. Odiava o Partido, e confessava-o',
    'em outras tantas palavras cruas, mas não',
    'o criticava em geral. Exceto no que tangia',
    'à sua vida particular, não lhe interessava',
    'a doutrina partidária. Ele observou que',
    'Júlia nunca usava palavras de Novilíngua,',
    'nem mesmo as que haviam passado à linguagem',
    'corrente. Nem nunca ouvira falar da Fraternidade,',
    'recusando-se mesmo a acreditar na sua existência.',
    'Considerava estúpida qualquer revolta organizada',
    'contra o Partido; fadada ao insucesso, dizia.',
    'O inteligente era desrespeitar a lei e continuar',
    'vivendo. Winston indagou de si mesmo, vagamente,',
    'quantos outros, como Júlia, devia haver',
    'na nova geração, jovens crescidos no',
    'mundo da Revolução, não sabendo nada',
    'mais, achando o Partido algo inalterável,',
    'como o céu, não se rebelando contra sua',
    'autoridade, mas simplesmente fugindo a ela,',
    'como um coelho evita o cão. Não discutiram',
    'a possibilidade de casamento. Era demasiado',
    'longínqua para merecer consideração.',
    'Nenhum comité imaginável sancionaria',
    'tais nupcias, mesmo que Winston pudesse se',
    'livrar de Katherine. Nem como sonho de olhos',
    'abertos oferecia esperança., Que tal era',
    'tua mulher?, indagou Júlia., Era. conheces',
    'a palavra de Novilíngua benpensante? Isto',
    'é, naturalmente ortodoxa, incapaz de um',
    'mau pensamento?, Não, não conheço',
    'a palavra, mas conheço o tipo, isso conheço.',
    'Ele pôs-se a contar-lhe a história de',
    'sua vida conjugal, mas o curioso é que',
    'ela já parecia conhecer as partes essenciais.',
    'Descreveu a Winston, quase como se o tivesse',
    'visto ou sentido, o enrijamento do corpo',
    'de Katheríne assim que ele a tocava, a',
    'maneira por que parecia ainda repeli-lo com',
    'tôda força, mesmo quando nele se enroscava',
    'com braços e pernas. Com Júlia ele não',
    'achava difícil falar de tais coisas: afinal,',
    'Katherine deixara de ser uma lembrança',
    'dolorosa para ser apenas desagradável.',
    '- Eu aguentaria se não fosse uma coisa',
    '- disse ele. Falou-lhe da frígida cerimoniazinha',
    'a que Katherine o forçava uma vez por semana.',
    '- Ela o detestava, mas nada conseguiria fazê-la',
    'mudar de idéia. Costumava chamar o ato',
    'de. .. és capaz de adivinhar?, Nosso dever',
    'para com o Partido, disse Júlia, prontamente.',
    'Como sabes? Também estive na escola, querido.',
    'Aulas de sexo uma vez por mês para as maiores',
    'de dezesseis. E no Movimento Juvenil. Esfregam',
    'na cara da gente, anos a fio. Sei que dá',
    'resultado, em muitas. Mas nunca se pode saber;',
    'há tantas hipócritas. Ela pôs-se a',
    'discorrer sobre o assunto. Com Júlia, tudo',
    'girava em tôrno da sua própria sexualidade.',
    'Assim que êste assunto vinha à balha,',
    'de algum modo, mostrava-se muito informada.',
    'Ao contrário de Winston, percebera o sentido',
    'íntimo do puritanismo sexual do Partido.',
    'Não era apenas pelo fato do instinto sexual',
    'criar um mundo próprio, fora do controle',
    'do Partido e que portanto devia ser destruido,',
    'se possível. O mais importante era a privação',
    'sexual que provocava a histeria, desejável',
    'porque podia ser transformada em febre guerreira',
    'e adoração dos chefes. Ou como explicava',
    'Júlia:, Quando amas, gastas energia; depois,',
    'ficas contente, satisfeito, e não te importas',
    'com coisa alguma. eles não gostam que',
    'te sintas assim. Querem que estoures de energia',
    'o tempo todo. Todo êsse negócio de marchar',
    'para cima e para baixo, dar vivas, agitar',
    'bandeirolas, é sexo que azedou. Se estás',
    'contente contigo mesmo, por que havias de',
    'admirar o Grande Irmão, os Planos Trienais',
    'e os Dois Minutos de ódio e todo o resto',
    'da maldita burrice? Era bem verdade, pensou',
    'ele. Havia uma ligação direta e íntima',
    'entre a castidade e a ortodoxia política.',
    'Como poderiam ser mantidos no tom o medo,',
    'o ódio e a credulidade lunática que o',
    'Partido necessitava nos seus membros, a não',
    'ser pelo engarrafamento de um poderoso instinto,',
    'usado como fôrça motriz? O impulso sexual',
    'era perigoso ao Partido e o Partido o transformara',
    'em vantagem a seu favor. A truque semelhante',
    'tinham submetido o instinto da paternidade.',
    'Como não era possível abolir a família',
    '(ao contrário, os pais eram incitados a',
    'gostar dos filhos quase à moda antiga)',
    'as crianças eram sistemàticamente atiradas',
    'contra os pais, e ensinadas a espioná-los',
    'e a denunciar os seus desvios. Dessa forma',
    'a família se tornára uma extensão da',
    'Polícia do Pensamento. Era um meio pelo',
    'qual todo mundo podia ser cercado, noite',
    'ou dia, por delatores que o conheciam intimamente.',
    'De sopetão, o pensamento de Winston voltou',
    'a Katherine. Sem dúvida, ela o denuncíaria',
    'à Polícia do Pensamento se não fosse',
    'tão estúpida que percebesse a heresia',
    'dos pensamentos. Mas o que na verdade a recordou',
    'foi o calor sufocante da tarde, que lhe cobria',
    'a testa de bagas de suor. Começou a contar',
    'a Júlia algo que acontecera, ou antes,',
    'que deixara de acontecer, numa tarde muito',
    'quente, onze anos atrás. Havia apenas três',
    'ou quatro meses que haviam casado. Tinham-',
    'se perdido num passeio comunal, em Kent.',
    'Haviam se afastado dos outros apenas uns',
    'minutos, mas tomado um caminho errado, e',
    'por fim se achado na beira de uma velha mina',
    'de calcáreo. Era uma queda vertical de',
    'dez ou vinte metros, com grandes rochas ao',
    'fundo. Não havia ninguém a quem perguntar',
    'a direção certa. Assim que descobriram',
    'estar perdidos, Katherine começou a ficar',
    'nervosa. Afastarse do bando barulhento, por',
    'uns minutos que fosse, dava-lhe a impressão',
    'de estar agindo mal. Queria correr de volta',
    'pelo caminho e procurar na outra direção.',
    'Mas nesse momento Winston notou uns tufos',
    'de prímulas crescendo nas grétas do penedo.',
    'Um tufo era de duas côres, maravilha e',
    'tijolo, aparentemente crescendo na mesma',
    'raiz. Nunca vira nada parecido, e chamou',
    'Katherine., Olha, Katherine! Olha aquelas',
    'flores. Aquele maço perto do fundo. Vês',
    'que são de côres diferentes? Ela já',
    'virara para regressar, mas veiu espiar, inquieta.',
    'Chegou até a inclinar-se sobre o rochedo',
    'para ver onde éle apontava. Winston estava',
    'parado, um pouco para trás, e segurou-a',
    'pela cintura para firmá-la. Naquele momento,',
    'ocorreu-lhe que estavam completamente sós.',
    'Não havia por ali nenhuma criatura humana,',
    'não se movia uma folha, não havia um',
    'pássaro acordado. Num lugar daqueles, era',
    'muito pequeno o perigo de haver um microfone',
    'escondido, e se microfone houvesse, só',
    'poderia captar sons. Era a hora mais quente,',
    'mais sonolenta da tarde. O sol fustigava-os,',
    'e a testa dele estava banhada em suor. Uma',
    'idéia lhe veiu., Por que não lhe deste',
    'um bom empurrão?, indagou Júlia., Eu',
    'daria., Sim, querida, já sei. Eu também,',
    'se fosse a pessoa que sou hoje. Ou talvez',
    'eu. não sei não., Lamentas não tê-la',
    'empurrado?, Lamento. De certo modo, foi',
    'uma pena. Estavam sentados, um ao lado do',
    'outro, sobre o soalho empoeirado. Puxou-a',
    'para mais perto. Júlia descansou a cabeça',
    'no ombro dele, e o aroma agradável dos',
    'seus cabelos sobrepujou o cheiro dos pombos.',
    'Era muito moça, pensou Winston, ainda esperava',
    'algo da vida, não compreendia não ser',
    'solução empurrar uma pessoa inconveniente,',
    'rochedo abaixo., Na verdade, não faria',
    'a menor diferença., Então por que lamentas',
    'não ter empurrado a zinha?, Por que prefiro',
    'uma positiva a uma negativa. Neste jôgo,',
    'não podemos ganhar. Alguns fracassos são',
    'melhores que outros, e é tudo. Sentiu-a',
    'dar de ombros, num movimento de desaprovação.',
    'Sempre o contradizia quando ele saía com',
    'essas. Não aceitava, como lei da natureza,',
    'a derrota do indivíduo. De certo modo percebia',
    'estar condenada, e que mais cedo ou mais',
    'tarde a Polícia do Pensamento a apanharia',
    'e mataria, mas com outra parte do cérebro',
    'acreditava ser possível construir um mundo',
    'secreto onde podia viver como quisesse. Tudo',
    'que precisava era sorte, esperteza e audácia.',
    'Não compreendia que não existia felicidade,',
    'que a única vitória estava no futuro',
    'distante, muito depois da morte, e que desde',
    'o momento de declarar guerra ao Partido era',
    'melhor considerarse cadáver., Estamos',
    'mortos, disse ele., Não estamos mortos',
    'ainda, contestou Júlia, prosàicamente.',
    '- Fisicamente, não. Seis meses, um ano.',
    'cinco anos concebivelmente. Tenho medo da',
    'morte. és jovem, de modo que presumo que',
    'tens mais medo que eu. Naturalmente, procuraremos',
    'evitá-la. Mas isso não faz muita diferença.',
    'Enquanto os humanos permanecerem humanos,',
    'a vida e a morte são a mesma coisa., Besteira!',
    'Com quem preferes dormir, comigo ou com um',
    'esqueleto? Não gostas de estar vivo? Não',
    'aprecias a sensação de dizer: êste',
    'sou eu, esta é minha mão, minha perna,',
    'sou real, sou sólido, sou vivo! Não gostas',
    'disto? Ela voltou-se e apertou os seios contra',
    'o corpo dele. Winston pôde sentir-lhe os',
    'peitos, maduros e firmes, sob o macacão.',
    'O corpo dela parecia transmitir ao seu um',
    'pouco de juventude e vigor., Gosto, sim.',
    '- Então para de falar de morte. E agora',
    'ouve, temos de combinar novo encontro. Já',
    'podemos voltar à clareira do bosque. Demos-lhe',
    'uma boa folga. Mas desta vez deves ir por',
    'caminho diferente. Já pensei em tudo. Pegas',
    'o trem. mas olha, já te desenho um mapa.',
    'E com seus modos práticos ela marcou um',
    'retângulo de pó e, tirando um pau do',
    'ninho de um pombo, pôs-se a riscar uma',
    'planta no chão. 12 Winston olhou em tôrno',
    'do quartinho mal ajambrado sobre a loja do',
    'sr. Charrington. Ao lado da janela, a cama',
    'enorme fora feita, com cobertores esfarrapados',
    'e um travesseiro sem fronha. O relógio',
    'antigo, de mostrador de doze horas, tiquetaqueava',
    'na lareira. No canto, sobre a mesa de abrir,',
    'o pêso de papéis que ele comprara na',
    'última visita cintilava suavemente na semi-obscuridade.',
    'Na guarda do fogão havia um veterano fogareiro',
    'a óleo, uma caçarola e duas xícaras,',
    'fornecidos pelo sr. Charrington. Winston',
    'acendeu o fogo e pôs a panela dágua a',
    'ferver. Trouxera um envelope cheio de Café',
    'Vitória e umas pastilhas de sacarina. Os',
    'ponteiros do relógio marcavam sete e vinte;',
    'na verdade eram dezenove e vinte. Ela devia',
    'chegar às dezenove e trinta. Loucura, loucura,.',
    'dizia-lhe o coração; loucura consciente,',
    'gratuita, suicida. De todos os crimes que',
    'um membro do Partido podia cometer, êste',
    'era o mais difícil de ocultar. A idéia',
    'a princípio lhe viera à cabeça sob',
    'forma de uma visão do pêso de vidro espelhado',
    'pela superfície da mesa de dobrar. Como',
    'previra, o antiquário acedera em alugar',
    'o quarto. Evidentemente, vinham a calhar',
    'uns dólares extra. Nem pareceu chocado',
    'ou desrespeitoso quando ficou claro que Winston',
    'queria o quarto com a finalidade de receber',
    'uma mulher. Ao invés, seu olhar perdeu-se',
    'na meia distância e ele falou de generalidades,',
    'com um ar tão delicado que parecia ter-se',
    'tornado parcialmente invisível. A poSsibilidade',
    'da solidão, disse ele, é muito valiosa.',
    'Todo mundo quer um lugar onde possa ficar',
    'só. E quando tem um lugar assim, é cortesia',
    'comum se calarem os que dele souberem. E',
    'apesar de parecer fanado e fora da vida,',
    'acrescentou até que a casa tinha duas entradas,',
    'sendo uma pelo quintal, que abria sobre o',
    'beco. Debaixo da janela, alguém cantava.',
    'Winston espiou para fora, protegido pela',
    'cortina de musselina. O sol de junho ainda',
    'boiava alto nos céus, e no pátio ensolarado',
    'uma mulher monstruosa, sólida como uma',
    'pilastra normanda, com formidandos antebraços',
    'avermelhados e um avental de aniagem na cintura,',
    'caminhava entre uma tina de lavar e um varal,',
    'estendendo uma porção de panos quadrados',
    'em que Winston reconheceu fraldas. Sempre',
    'que não tinha a boca cheia de prendedores,',
    'cantava, com poderosa voz de contralto: "Foi',
    'apenas uma fantasia desesperada, Que passou',
    'como um dia de abril, Mas um olhar, uma palavra,',
    'e os sonhos provocados, Roubaram o meu coração',
    'gentil!" Havia semanas que a canção estava',
    'em voga em Londres. Era uma das músicas',
    'sem conta, publicadas para os proles, por',
    'uma sub-secção do Departamento de Música.',
    'As letras eram compostas, sem intervenção',
    'humana, num instrumento chamado versificador.',
    'Mas a mulher cantava com tamanho sentimento',
    'que transformava aquéla horrível pieguice',
    'num som quase agradável. Winston podia',
    'ouvir a mulher cantando e o ranger dos sapatos',
    'no lagedo, gritos de crianças nas ruas,',
    'e às vezes, na distância, o regougo esmaecido',
    'do tráfego, e no entanto o quarto parecia',
    'curiosamente mudo, por causa da ausência',
    'da teletela. Loucura, loucura, loucura! tornou',
    'a pensar. Era inconcebível que pudessem',
    'frequentar aquele lugar por mais de algumas',
    'semanas sem serem descobertos. Mas a tentação',
    'de ter um esconderijo que fosse verdadeiramente',
    'deles, dentro de casa, à mão, fora demasiada.',
    'Durante algum tempo após a visita ao campanário',
    'da igreja, não tinham podido se encontrar.',
    'As horas de trabalho tinham sido dràsticamente',
    'aumentadas, à espera da Semana do ódio.',
    'Ainda faltava mais de um mês, porém os',
    'preparativos vastos, complexos, exigiam trabalho',
    'extra de todo mundo. Afinal, ambos haviam',
    'conseguido a mesma tarde livre. Tinham combinado',
    'ir à clareira do bosque. Como sempre, Winston',
    'mal olhou para Júlia, quando se cruzaram',
    'no meio da multidão. Mas pela breve olhada',
    'que lhe lançou, pareceu-lhe que estava',
    'mais pálida do que do costume., Não',
    'pode ser, murmurou, assim que julgou seguro',
    'falar., Quero dizer, amanhã não posso.',
    '- Que?, Amanhã de tarde, não posso ir.',
    '- Por que?, Pelo motivo comum. Desta vez',
    'começou cedo. Por um momento, ele se sentiu',
    'furioso. Naquele mês, volvido desde que',
    'a conhecera intimamente, modificara-se a',
    'natureza do seu desejo. No comêço, pouca',
    'sensualidade houvera nele. O primeiro contacto',
    'amoroso fora simplesmente um ato de volição.',
    'Mas depois da segunda vez as coisas haviam',
    'mudado de figura. O aroma dos cabelos, o',
    'gôsto da boca, a maciez da pele pareciam',
    'havê-lo penetrado, ou envolvê-lo. Ela',
    'se tornara uma necessidade física, algo',
    'que não apenas queria como sentia ter direito',
    'a gozar. Quando Júlia anunciou que não',
    'poderia ir, teve a impressão de estar sendo',
    'lesado. Mas naquele momento a multidão',
    'os apertou e, acidentalmente, as mãos se',
    'encontraram. Ela apertou-lhe ligeiramente',
    'as pontas dos dedos, num gesto que parecia',
    'pedir não desejo mas afeto. Winston raciocinou',
    'que, quando se vive com uma mulher, êsse',
    'tipo de desapontamento deve ser uma coisa',
    'normal, que acontece mais de uma vez; de',
    'repente, domínou-o uma profunda ternura,',
    'como nunca sentira antes. Desejou que fossem',
    'um casal com dez anos de existência em',
    'comum. Desejou passear com ela pelas ruas,',
    'como estavam fazendo naquele instante, mas',
    'abertamente, sem medo, falando de frivolidades',
    'e comprando pequenas bobagens para o lar.',
    'Desejou, acima de tudo, que tivessem um lugar',
    'onde ficar a sós, sem sentir a obrigação',
    'de fazer o amor, cada vez que se encontravam.',
    'Não foi exatamente naquele instante, mas',
    'no dia seguinte, que lhe ocorreu alugar o',
    'quarto do antiquário. Quando sugeriu o',
    'plano a Júlia, ela concordou com inesperada',
    'presteza. Ambos sabiam ser loucura. Era como',
    'se dessem, de propósito, um passo para',
    'o túmulo. Sentado na beira da cama, Wínston',
    'tornou a pensar nos porões do Ministério',
    'do Amor. Era curioso que aquele horror predestinado',
    'se acendesse e apagasse na sua consciência.',
    'Lá estava ele, fixado no tempo futuro,',
    'precedendo a morte com a mesma certeza que',
    '99 precede 100. Não era possível evitá-lo,',
    'mas talvez fosse adiá-lo; e no entanto,',
    'ao invés disso, de vez em quando, ele encurtava',
    'a vida, por um ato consciente, voluntário.',
    'Naquele momento, ouviu-se um passo rápido',
    'nas escadas. Júlia irrompeu no quarto.',
    'Trazia um saco de ferramentas de lona marron',
    'crua, com que às vezes a vira entrando',
    'e saindo do Ministério. Tentou colhê-la',
    'nos braços, mas Júlia desvencilhou-se',
    'um tanto apressada, em parte por estar ainda',
    'com a bolsa na mão., Meio segundo, disse.',
    '- Olha só o que eu trouxe. Trouxeste êsse',
    'horrendo Café Vitória? Logo vi. Podes',
    'levá-lo de volta, porque não precisamos',
    'dele. Olha. Ajoelhou-se, abriu a bolsa, e',
    'tirou algumas chaves- inglêsas e de fenda',
    'que enchiam a parte superior. Por baixo havia',
    'vários pacotes de papel. O primeiro embrulho',
    'que entregou a Winston lhe pareceu, ao tato,',
    'ter uma consistência estranha e no entanto',
    'vagamente familiar. Estava cheio de uma substância',
    'pesada, pulverulenta, que cedia onde se apertasse',
    'o papel., é açúcar?, Açúcar de',
    'verdade. Nada de sacarina. E aqui temos um',
    'pão, um pão branco, decente, não aquela',
    'broa insôssa, e uma latinha de geléia.',
    'Uma lata de leite. e olha! Disto eu me',
    'orgulho. Tive de enrolá-lo numa estopa,',
    'Po\'rque. Mas não era preciso explicar',
    'porque o enrolára. O aroma já enchia',
    'o quarto, um aroma rico e convidativo, que',
    'lhe parecia uma emanação da meninice,',
    'mas que de vez em quando ainda sentia, propagando-se',
    'por um corredor antes de uma porta bater,',
    'ou espalhando-se misteriosamente numa rua',
    'cheia de gente; um cheiro olfateado uns segundos',
    'e depois perdido de novo., é café -',
    'murmurou Winston., Café de verdade. -',
    'Café do Partido Interno. Um quilo inteiro',
    'aqui., Como conseguiste arranjar tudo isto?',
    '- é tudo para o Partido Interno. Não',
    'há nada que aqueles suinos não tenham.',
    'Nada. Mas naturalmente os garçons e os',
    'empregados afanam as coisas e. olha, trouxe',
    'também um pacotinho de chá. Winston acocorara-se',
    'ao pé de Júlia. Rasgou um bico do pacote.',
    '- Chá mesmo. Não são folhas de amora.',
    '- Tem rodado muito chá por aí. Capturaram',
    'a índia, sei lá, explicou ela, vagamente.',
    '- Mas escuta, querido. Quero que me dês',
    'as costas três minutos. Vai sentar do outro',
    'lado da cama. Não chegues à janela. E',
    'não olhes enquanto eu não te disser.',
    'Winston ficou olhando, distraído, através',
    'da cortina de musselina. Lá no pátio',
    'a mulher dos braços avermelhados continuava',
    'marchando da tina para o varal, e vice-versa.',
    'Tirou dois prendedores de roupa da boca e',
    'cantou com profundo sentimento: "Dizem que',
    'o tempo tudo cura, Dizem que sempre se pode',
    'esquecer, Mas os sorrisos e lágrimas, anos',
    'a fio, Ainda fazem meu coração sofrer."',
    'Sabia de cor a estúpida\' canção. A',
    'voz subia, boiando no doce ar estival, muito',
    'afinada, carregada de uma espécie de feliz',
    'melancolia. Tinha-se a impressão de que',
    'ficaria perfeitamente contente se a noite',
    'de junho fosse infindável, e inesgotável',
    'o monte de roupa suja, para ficar ali mil',
    'anos, pendurando fraldas no varal e cantarolando',
    'bobagens. E Winston achou curioso o fato',
    'de nunca ter ouvido um membro do Partido',
    'cantar a sós, espontâneamente. Isso teria',
    'parecido ligeiramente ortodoxo, uma excentricidade',
    'perigosa, como falar sózinho. Talvez fosse',
    'apenas quando as pessoas estão próximas',
    'da fome que sentem desejo de cantar., Já',
    'podes virar, disse Júlia. Ele voltou-se',
    'e, por um segundo, quase não pôde reconhecê-la.',
    'Francamente, esperara vê-la nua. Mas Júlia',
    'não estava nua. Operara uma transformação',
    'muito mais surpreendente. Pintara o rosto.',
    'Devia ter ido a uma loja do bairro proletário',
    'e comprado um jôgo completo de cosmética.',
    'Passara baton forte nos lábios, ruge nas',
    'faces, pó de arroz no nariz; até havia,',
    'em tôrno dos olhos, um toque de tinta que',
    'os realçava. A maquilagem não fora bem',
    'feita, mas nesse particular Winston não',
    'tinha grandes exigencias. Não havia nunca',
    'visto ou imaginado uma mulher do Partido',
    'usando cosméticos. Era espantosa a melhora',
    'do seu aspecto. Com uns retoques de cor aqui',
    'e ali Júlia não apenas se fizera muito',
    'mais bonita como, sobretudo, mais feminina.',
    'O cabelo curto e o macacão masculinizante',
    'apenas davam destaque a êsse efeito. Quando',
    'a tomou nos braços, uma onda de violeta',
    'sintética lhe invadiu as narinas. Lembrou-lhe',
    'a semi-escuridão de uma cozinha no sub-solo',
    'e a boca cavernosa de uma mulher. Era o mesmo',
    'cheiro; mas não importava., E perfume,',
    'também!, Sim, querido. Perfume também!',
    'E sabes o que vou trazer da próxima vez?',
    'Vou arranjar um vestido de verdade, vestido',
    'de mulher, não sei ainda onde, e vou usá-lo',
    'em vêz destas calças horrorosas. E vou',
    'usar meias de seda e sapatos de salto alto!',
    'Neste quarto serei mulher, não uma militante',
    'do Partido! Jogaram a roupa para o lado e',
    'se aboletaram na vasta cama de mogno. Era',
    'a primeira vez que ele se despia de todo',
    'em presença dela. Até então tivera',
    'muita vergonha do corpo pálido e magro,',
    'das varizes saltadas na barriga da perna',
    'e a mancha acima do tornozelo. Não havia',
    'lençóis, porém o cobertor sobre o qual',
    'se haviam deitado era poído e liso, o tamanho',
    'e a elasticidade da cama os encheram de espanto.',
    '- Com certeza está cheia de percevejos,',
    'mas que importa?, disse Júlia. Não se',
    'viam mais camas de casal, exceto na casa',
    'dos proles. Winston algumas vezes dormira',
    'numa, na infância. Júlia jamais, tanto',
    'quanto podia se lembrar. Dali a pouco adormeceram.',
    'Quando Winston acordou os ponteiros do relógio',
    'indicavam quase nove. Não se mexeu, porque',
    'Júlia estava dormindo com a cabeça apoiada',
    'na curva do braço dele. A maior parte da',
    'maquilagem se transferira para a cara dele',
    'e o travesseiro, porém uma mancha de ruge',
    'ainda realçava a beleza das maçãs do',
    'rosto de Júlia. Um raio amarelo do sol',
    'poente atravessava oblíquo os pés da',
    'cama e iluminava a lareira, onde fervia ruidosamente',
    'a água da caçarola. No pátio, a mulher',
    'se calara, porém débeis gritos de crianças',
    'ainda flutuavam no ar, vindos da rua. Winston',
    'ficou a meditar vagamente se no passado abolido',
    'fora normal dormirem numa cama assim, na',
    'fresca de uma noite de verão, um homem',
    'e uma mulher sem roupa, fazendo o amor quando',
    'quisessem, falando do que bem entendessem,',
    'sem sentir nenhuma obrigação de levantar,',
    'simplesmente largados no leito ouvindo os',
    'ruidos pacíficos lá de fora. Não era',
    'possível que tivesse havido uma era em',
    'que tais coisas fossem comuns. Júlia acordou,',
    'esfregou os olhos e ergueu-se num cotovelo,',
    'para olhar o fogareiro., Metade da água',
    'evaporou, disse ela. Daqui a um minuto levanto',
    'e faço café. Ainda temos uma hora. A',
    'que horas cortam a luz no teu prédio? -',
    'às vinte e três e trinta., Na minha',
    'hospedaria às vinte e três. Mas precisas',
    'chegar mais cedo porque. Ei! Vai-te embora,',
    'bicho imundo! Ela de repente enredou-se na',
    'cama, apanhou um sapato do chão e atirou-o',
    'com fôrça a um canto, com um gesto vigoroso,',
    'juvenil, como ele a vira fazer, jogando o',
    'dicionário em Goldstein, aquela manhã,',
    'durante os Dois Minutos de ódio. Que foi?',
    'Um rato. Mostrou o focinho ali naquele buraco',
    'do rodapé. Estás vendo o buraco? Preguei-lhe',
    'um bom susto., Ratos!, murmurou Winston.',
    '- Neste quarto!, Andam por toda parte -',
    'disse Júlia, indiferente, tornando a deitar-se.',
    '- Vivem até na cozinha da pensão. Alguns',
    'bairros de Londres pululam de ratos. Sabias',
    'que atacam criancinhas? Pois é, atacam.',
    'Em algumas dessas ruas, uma mulher não',
    'tem coragem de deixar um filho sózinho',
    'dois minutos. São os grandões, pardos,',
    'os piores. E o mais horrível é que -os',
    'brutos., Chega!, implorou Winston, cerrando',
    'os olhos., Querido! Estás tão pálido?',
    'Que aconteceu? Tens nojo de ratos?, De todos',
    'os horrores do mundo. um rato! Ela apertou-se',
    'contra ele e enrolou as pernas e os braços',
    'nele, como se para tranquilizá-lo com o',
    'calor de seu corpo. Ele não reabriu os',
    'olhos imediatamente. Por alguns momentos',
    'tivera a sensação de voltar a um pesadelo',
    'que se repetia ciclicamente na sua vida.',
    'Era sempre a mesma coisa. Estava parado diante',
    'duma muralha de trevas, e do outro lado da',
    'muralha havia algo insuportável, algo demasiado',
    'horrível para se fazer face. No sonho,',
    'a sua sensação mais profunda era sempre',
    'de auto- engano, porque de fato não sabia',
    'o que havia atrás da muralha de treva.',
    'Com um esfôrço fatal, como se arrancasse',
    'um pedaço do próprio cérebro, poderia',
    'ter trazido o mistério à luz. Mas sempre',
    'acordava sem descobrir o que era: de certo',
    'modo, porém, ligava-se com o que dizia',
    'Júlia quando a interrompera., Desculpa',
    '- pediu ele., Não é nada. é que não',
    'gosto de ratos e pronto., Não te preocupes,',
    'querido, não deixarei que os bicharocos',
    'entrem aqui. Vou calafetar o buraco com aniagem,',
    'antes de sairmos. E da próxima vez trago',
    'reboco e tapo o orifício direitinho. já',
    'fora meio esquecido o instante negro de pânico.',
    'Sentindo- se ligeiramente envergonhado de',
    'si mesmo, ele sentouse, encostando na guarda',
    'da cama. Júlia saltou, vestiu o macacão',
    'e fez café. O cheiro que se elevou da caçarola',
    'era tão poderoso e inebriante que eles',
    'fecharam a janela, não fosse alguém senti-lo',
    'e começar a especular. Ainda melhor que',
    'o sabor do café era a textura sedosa que',
    'lhe dava o açúcar, de que Winston quase',
    'esquecera após tantos anos de sacarina.',
    'Com a mão no bolso e segurando uma fatia',
    'de pão com geléia na outra, Júlia passeou',
    'pelo quarto, dando olhadas indiferentes à',
    'estante de livros, indicando a melhor maneira',
    'de consertar a mesa dobradiça, atirando-se',
    'na velha poltrona estofada para ver se era',
    'confortável, e examinando o absurdo relógio',
    'de doze horas com uma espécie de chacota',
    'tolerante. Levou para a cama o pêso de',
    'papéis, para examiná-lo na luz melhor.',
    'Ele tomou-o, fascinado, como sempre, pelo',
    'aspecto macio, de água de chuva, do vidro',
    'secular., Que é isto?, indagou Júlia.',
    '- Não creio que seja nada. quer dizer,',
    'não creio que tenha servido para nada.',
    'é por isso que gosto dele. é um pedacinho',
    'de história que se esqueceram de alterar.',
    'é uma mensagem de cem anos atrás, se',
    'ao menos soubéssemos lê-la., E aquela',
    'gravura ali, Júlia indicou com a cabeça',
    'o quadro na parede oposta, também tem',
    'cem anos de idade?, Mais. Talvez duzentos.',
    'Não se sabe. Hoje em dia é impossível',
    'descobrir a idade de qualquer coisa. Ela',
    'foi espiá-la., Foi aqui que o bruto meteu',
    'o focinho, disse, dando um chute no rodapé,',
    'logo abaixo do quadro., Que lugar é êsse?',
    'Já vi essa casa., é uma igreja, ou foi',
    'uma igreja. Chamava-se S. Clemente dos Dinamarqueses.',
    '- O fragmento de cantiga que o sr. Charrington',
    'lhe ensinara voltou-lhe à memória e ele',
    'acrescentou, quase com saudade:, Laranjas',
    'e limões, dizem os sinos de S. Clemente!',
    'Para sua imensa surpresa, Júlia continuou:',
    '- Me deves três vinténs, dizem os sinos',
    'de S. Martinho, Quando me pagarás? dizem',
    'os sinos de Old Bailey. Não me lembro',
    'como é que continua. Só sei que acaba',
    'assim: Aí vem uma luz para te levar para',
    'a cama. Aí vem um machado para te cortar',
    'a cabeça! Pareciam santo e senha. Mas devía',
    'haver outro verso depois de "os sinos de',
    'Old Bailey." Talvez conseguisse arrancá-lo',
    'da lembrança do sr. Charrington, se o espicaçasse',
    'bem., Quem te ensinou isso?, Meu avô.',
    'Costumava cantar-me essa cantiga quando eu',
    'era menina. Foi vaporizado quando eu tinha',
    'oito anos. ou pelo menos desapareceu. O',
    'que será limão? -acrescentou, inconsequente.',
    '- Já vi laranja. é uma espécie de fruta',
    'redonda, amarela, com casca grossa., Eu',
    'me lembro do limão. Era bem comum até',
    '1950 e pouco. Era tão azedo que só de',
    'cheirar a gente ficava com a boca amarga.',
    '- Aposto que êsse quadro tem bichos por',
    'trás, disse Júlia., Um dia dêstes',
    'arranco-o daí e dou-lhe uma boa limpadela.',
    'Acho que já é hora de irmos embora. Preciso',
    'tirar esta tinta da cara. Que chatura! Depois',
    'tiro o baton do teu rosto. Winston só levantou',
    'dali a uns minutos. O quarto escurecia. Voltou-se',
    'para a luz e ficou examinando o pêso de',
    'papéis. O que lhe oferecia inexaustível',
    'interêsse não era o fragmento de coral,',
    'porém o interior do vidro em si. Tinha',
    'tremenda profundidade e no entanto era quase',
    'transparente como o ar. Como se a superfície',
    'do vidro fosse a abóbada celeste, contendo',
    'um pequenino mundo, completo com sua atmosfera.',
    'Winston tinha a impressão de poder penetrá-lo,',
    'e que de fato estava nele, junto com a cama',
    'de mogno e a mesa dobradiça, o relógio,',
    'a gravura em aço e o próprio pêso de',
    'papéis. O pêso de vidro era o quarto',
    'em que estava, e o coral era a vida de Júlia',
    'e a dele, fixadas para a eternidade no coração',
    'do cristal. 13 Syme desaparecera. Um dia,',
    'faltou ao trabalho: alguns levianos comentaram',
    'sua ausência. No dia seguinte ninguém',
    'mais falou dele. No terceiro dia, Winston',
    'foi ao vestíbulo do Departamento de Registro,',
    'examinar o indicador geral. Um dos avisos',
    'era uma lista impressa de membros do Comité',
    'de Xadrez, do qual Syme fizera parte. Tinha',
    'quase exatamente o mesmo aspecto que antes',
    '- nada fora riscado -mas faltava um nome.',
    'Bastava. Syme deixara de existir: nunca existira.',
    'Fazia um calor infernal. No labirinto ministerial,',
    'as salas sem janelas, com ar condicionado,',
    'tinham temperatura normal, mas lá fora',
    'as calçadas assavam os pés da gente,',
    'e era um horror o mau cheiro dos subterrâneos',
    'na hora de maior tráfego. Iam a pleno vapor',
    'os preparativos para a Semana do ódio,',
    'e o pessoal de todos os ministérios trabalhava',
    'extraordinário. Passeatas, comícios,',
    'paradas militares, conferências, exposições',
    'de bonecos de cera, sessões cinematográficas,',
    'programas de teletela, era preciso organizar',
    'tudo; era preciso montar palanques, fazer',
    'efígies, inventar lemas, escrever canções,',
    'circular boatos, falsificar fotos. Os colegas',
    'de Júlia, no Departamento de Ficção,',
    'haviam suspendido a produção de novelas',
    'e estavam redigindo uma série de panfletos',
    'de atrocidades. Winston, além do seu serviço',
    'regular, passava longas horas, todos os dias,',
    'examinando exemplares atrasados do Times,',
    'alterando e embelezando tópicos que seriam',
    'citados nos discursos. Tarde da noite, quando',
    'bandos de proles desordeiros vagabundeavam',
    'pelas ruas, a cidade tinha um ar curiosamente',
    'febril. As bombasfoguetes caíam com maior',
    'freqüência e às vezes havia, na distância,',
    'enormes explosões, que ninguém sabia',
    'explicar, e a respeito das quais corriam',
    'cabeludos boatos. A nova toada que seria',
    'prefixo musical da Semana do ódio (Canção',
    'do ódio, era o seu título) já fora',
    'composta e era tocada incessantemente nas',
    'teletelas. Tinha um ritmo selvagem, de latido,',
    'que não podia exatamente ser chamado de',
    'música, e parecia o rufar de um tambor.',
    'Entoada por centenas de vozes, ao som de',
    'passos em marcha, era aterrorizante. Os proles',
    'a haviam adotado e nas ruas, à noite, competia',
    'com a sempre popular "Foi apenas uma fantasia',
    'desesperada". Os filhos dos Parsons a tocavam,',
    'a qualquer hora da noite ou do dia, com um',
    'pente e um pedaço de papel higiênico.',
    'As noites de Winston estavam mais ocupadas',
    'que nunca. Bandos de voluntários, organizados',
    'por Parsons, preparavam a rua, para a Semana,',
    'cosendo bandeiras e faixas, pintando cartazes,',
    'fixando paus de bandeira nos telhados e arriscando',
    'o pescoço para esticar fios através da',
    'rua, para suster as faixas. Parsons gabava-se',
    'de que só a Mansão Vitóría exibiria',
    'quatrocentos metros de fita agaloada. Sentia-se',
    'no seu elemento e andava alegre que só',
    'um periquito. O calor e o trabalho manual',
    'lhe haviam dado pretexto para usar shorts',
    'e camisa aberta. Andava por toda parte, empurrando,',
    'puxando, serrando, martelando, improvisando,',
    'alegrando todo mundo, incitando os camaradas',
    'com exortações e soltando, de cada dobra',
    'do corpo, uma nuvem inesgotável de cheiro',
    'acre de suor. De repente, aparecera por toda',
    'Londres um novo cartaz. Não tinha legenda,',
    'e representava simplesmente a monstruosa',
    'figura de um soldado eurasiano, de três',
    'ou quatro metros de altura, avançando com',
    'enormes botas e uma cara mongólica sem',
    'expressão, apontando uma metralhadora portátil',
    'apoiada no quadril. De onde quer que se olhasse',
    'o cartaz, o cano da metralhadora, ampliado',
    'pela perspectiva, parecia apontar para a',
    'gente. O cartaz enchera todos os espaços',
    'livres, tornando- se mais numeroso do que',
    'os retratos do Grande Irmão. Os proles,',
    'normalmente apáticos em relação à',
    'guerra, estavam sendo incitados a um dos',
    'cíclicos frenesis de patriotismo. Como',
    'que para se harmonizar com a atitude geral,',
    'as bombas- foguetes matavam mais gente do',
    'que de costume. Uma caiu em Stepney, num',
    'cinema cheio, sepultando várias centenas',
    'de vítimas nas ruinas. Tôda a população',
    'da vizinhança saiu à rua, para um longuíssimo',
    'cortejo fúnebre, que durou horas e foi,',
    'na verdade, um comício de indígnação.',
    'Outra bomba caiu sobre um terreno baldio',
    'usado como parque infantil, e fez picadinho',
    'de várias dezenas de crianças. Houve',
    'outras demonstrações de raiva, Goldstein',
    'foi queimado em efígie, centenas de cartazes',
    'do soldado eurasiano foram rasgados e jogados',
    'nas fogueiras, e uma porção de lojas',
    'foram pilhadas, na confusão; correu então',
    'um boato de que os espiões estavam dirigindo',
    'as bombasfoguete por meio de ondas de rádio,',
    'e um velho casal, suspeito de ser de origem',
    'estrangeira, teve a casa incendiada e morreu',
    'sufocado. No quarto em cima da loja do sr.',
    'Charrington, quando conseguiam ir lá, Júlia',
    'e Winston ficavam deitados, lado a lado,',
    'na cama debaixo da janela, nus por causa',
    'do calor. O rato não voltara mais, porém',
    'os percevejos se haviam multiplicado nefandamente.',
    'Não parecia lhes importar. Sujo ou limpo,',
    'o quarto era o paraíso. Assim que chegavam,',
    'polvilhavam tudo com pimenta comprada no',
    'mercado negro, tiravam a roupa e faziam o',
    'amor com o corpo suado, adormeciam e despertavam',
    'para verificàr que os percevejos haviam',
    'reagido e se agrupavam para o contra-ataque.',
    'Durante o mês de junho encontraram-se quatro,',
    'cinco, seis. sete vezes. Winston abandonara',
    'o hábito de beber gin a toda hora. Parecia',
    'não precisar mais dele. Engordara, a variz',
    'ulcerada sarára, deixando apenas uma nódoa',
    'parda na pele, acima do tornozelo; não',
    'sofria mais de acessos de tosse de madrugada.',
    'O processo da vida cessara de ser intolerável,',
    'e não sentia mais ímpetos de fazer caretas',
    'para a teletela nem de gritar nomes feios.',
    'Agora que possuíam um esconderijo seguro,',
    'quase um lar, já não lhes parecia tão',
    'mau encontrar- se freqüentemente, e apenas',
    'por algumas horas. O que importava era a',
    'existência do quarto sobre a loja do antiquário.',
    'Saber que estava lá, inviolado, era quase',
    'o mesmo que estar nele. O quarto era um mundo,',
    'uma redoma do passado, onde sobreviviam animais',
    'extintos. O antiquário, pensava Winston,',
    'era outro animal extinto. Geralmente se detinha',
    'uns minutos para conversar com ele, antes',
    'de subir. O velho parecia sair raramente,',
    'ou nunca, e tampouco parecia ter fregueses.',
    'Levava uma existência fantasmal entre a',
    'lojinha escura e uma cozinha ainda menor',
    'onde preparava as refeições e que continha,',
    'entre outras coisas, um gramofone incrivelmente',
    'antigo, com uma enorme trompa. Parecia contente',
    'de poder conversar. Perambulando no meio',
    'do seu estoque de frioleiras, com o nariz',
    'comprido, os óculos espessos, e os ombros',
    'arcados metidos num paletó de veludo, tinha',
    'sempre um ar vago mais de colecionador de',
    'que de mercador. Com desbotado entusiasmo',
    'acariciava uma velharia insignificante -',
    'uma tampa de porcelana para garrafa, um pedaço',
    'pintado de caixa de rapé, um medalhão',
    'de pechisbeque contendo um anel de cabelo',
    'de alguma criança morta, sem nunca pedir',
    'a Winston que comprasse nada, mas apenas',
    'que admirasse. Conversar com ele era como',
    'ouvir uma caixa de música já gasta. Tirara',
    'dos cantos da memória outros fragmentos',
    'de cançonetas esquecidas. Havia uma que',
    'falava de vinte e quatro gralhas, outra a',
    'respeito duma vaca de chifre partido, e ainda',
    'outra sobre a morte do pobre pintarroxo.',
    '- Pensei que o sr. poderia se interessar',
    '- dizia, com uma risadinha de desculpas,',
    'sempre que apresentava novo fragmento. Mas',
    'nunca podia lembrar mais do que alguns versos',
    'de cada canção. Winston e Júlia sabiam',
    '- de modo que nunca baniam do espírito',
    '- que não podia durar muito o que estava',
    'acontecendo. Havia ocasiões em que a morte',
    'vindoura parecia tão palpável quanto',
    'a cama que ocupavam, e então se agarravam',
    'com uma espécie de desesperada sensualidade,',
    'como uma alma danada se agarra ao último',
    'bocado de prazer quando faltam apenas cinco',
    'minutos para soar a hora. Mas havia também',
    'ocasiões em que tinham a ilusão não',
    'apenas de segurança como de permanência.',
    'Tinham a impressão de que, enquanto estivessem',
    'naquele quarto, nenhum mal lhes poderia advir.',
    'Chegar até lá era difícil e perigoso,',
    'mas o quarto era um santuário. Era como',
    'se Winston olhasse dentro do pêso de papel,',
    'com sensação de ser possível penetrar',
    'aquele mundo de vidro, e que, uma vez dentro',
    'dele, o tempo se ímobilizaria. Com frequencia',
    'se entregavam a sonhos escapistas conscientes.',
    'A sorte haveria de ajudá-los, indefinídamente,',
    'e continuariam a aventura até o fim da',
    'vida natural. Ou Katherine morreria e, com',
    'auxílio de manobras sutis, Winston e Júlia',
    'conseguiriam casar. Ou então se suicidariam',
    'juntos. Ou desapareceriam, alterando as fisionomias',
    'de modo que ninguém os reconhecesse, aprenderiam',
    'a falar com sotaque proletário, arranjariam',
    'emprêgo numa fábrica e viveriam até',
    'o fim numa ruela obscura. Tudo tolice, como',
    'bem sabiam. Na verdade, não havia fuga.',
    'Não tinham intenção de executar nem',
    'o único plano praticável, o suicidio.',
    'Viver dia a dia, semana a semana, esticando',
    'um presente que não tinha futuro, parecia',
    'um instinto irresistível, como os nossos',
    'pulmões sempre procuram inspirar, enquanto',
    'existe ar. às vezes, falavam também de',
    'se dedicar à rebelião ativa contra o',
    'Partido, sem a menor noção de como dar',
    'o primeiro passo. Mesmo que a fabulosa Fraternidade',
    'existisse, havia o problema de encontrar',
    'o caminho dos seus quadros. Contou a Júlia',
    'a estranha intimidade que existia, ou parecia',
    'existir, entre ele e O\'Brien, e o impulso',
    'que às vezes sentia, de comparecer simplesmente',
    'à presença de O\'Brien, anunciar-se como',
    'inimigo do Partido e pedir-lhe auxílio.',
    'Curioso que isto não parecesse a Júlia',
    'nada de impossivelmente audacioso. Estava',
    'acostumada a julgar as pessoas pela fisionomia,',
    'e lhe parecia natural que Winston acreditasse',
    'e confiasse em O\'Brien, por causa de uma',
    'simples olhada. Além do mais, parecia-lhe',
    'ponto pacífico que todo mundo, ou quase,',
    'odiava secretamente o Partido e haveria de',
    'quebrar suas leis, se acreditasse poder fazê-lo',
    'em segurança. Mas recusava-se a acreditar',
    'que existisse, ou pudesse existir, oposição',
    'generalizada, organizada. As caraminholas',
    'a respeito de Goldstein e o seu exército',
    'clandestino, dizia ela, não passavam de',
    'besteiras que o Partido inventara, para servir',
    'aos seus propósitos, e que os militantes',
    'fingiam crer. Vezes sem conta, em comícios',
    'do Partido e demonstrações espontâneas,',
    'ela gritara a plenos pulmões, pedindo a',
    'execução de gente cujos nomes nunca ouvira',
    'e em cujos supostos crimes não acreditava',
    'de modo algum. Quando se haviam realizado',
    'os julgamentos públicos, ocupara o seu',
    'lugar nos destacamentos da Liga da Juventude',
    'que circundavam o tribunal, de manhã à',
    'noite, entoando ritmicamente "Morte aos traidores!"',
    'Durante os Dois Minutos de ódio sempre',
    'superava os outros nos insultos a Goldstein.',
    'Entretanto tinha idéia muito obscura de',
    'quem fosse Goldstein e que doutrinas pregava.',
    'Crescera depois da Revolução e era moça',
    'demais para se lembrar das batalhas ideológicas',
    'de 1950 a 1970. Era coisa que não podia',
    'imaginar um movimento político independente:',
    'e depois, o Partido era invencível. Sempre',
    'existiria, e seria sempre o mesmo. Só era',
    'possível rebelar-se contra ele por desobediência',
    'secreta ou, no máximo, por atos isolados',
    'de violência, como assassinar alguém,',
    'dinamitar alguma coisa. De certo modo era',
    'muito mais alerta do que Winston, e muitíssimo',
    'menos suscetível à propaganda do Partido.',
    'Uma vez, quando ele mencionou a guerra contra',
    'a Eurásia, a propósito de qualquer coisa,',
    'ela o espantou dizendo, com toda a naturalidade',
    'que, na sua opinião, não havia guerra',
    'alguma. As bombas-foguete que caíam diàriamente',
    'sobre Londres eram provavelmente disparadas',
    'pelo govêrno da própria Oceania, "só',
    'para amedrontar a turma." Era uma idéia',
    'que jamais ocorrera a Winston. Também provocou',
    '-uma espécie de inveja nele contando-lhe',
    'que durante os Dois Minutos de ódio tinha',
    'grande dificuldade para não estourar em',
    'gargalhadas. Porém só punha em dúvida',
    'os ensinamentos do Partido quando a interessavam',
    'pessoalmente. No mais, estava disposta a',
    'aceitar a mitologia oficial, simplesmente',
    'porque a diferença entre verdade e mentira',
    'não lhe parecia importante. Acreditava,',
    'por exemplo, e porque o aprendera na escola,',
    'que o Partido inventara o aeroplano. (Quando',
    'ele estava na escola, recordava Winston,',
    'antes de 1960, o Partido só afirmava ter',
    'inventado o helicóptero; doze anos mais',
    'tarde, no tempo de Júlia, já reclamava',
    'o avião; dali a uma geração com certeza',
    'se apossaria da máquina a vapor.) E quando',
    'ele disse que os aviões existiam antes',
    'dele nascer, e muito antes da Revolução,',
    'o fato pareceu a Júlia totalmente sem interêsse.',
    'Afinal, que importava o inventor dos aeroplanos?',
    'Foi choque maior para ele descobrir, por',
    'um comentário passageiro, que ela não',
    'se lembrava de que, quatro anos atrás,',
    'a Oceania estivera em guerra com a Lestásia,',
    'e em paz com a Eurásia. Era verdade que',
    'considerava a guerra uma farça; mas aparentemente',
    'não notára nem a mudança do nome do',
    'inimigo. "Pensei que sempre estivéssemos',
    'em guerra com a Eurásia," exclamou, evasivamente.',
    'Isso o amedrontou um pouco. A invenção',
    'dos aeroplanos sucedera antes de Júlia',
    'nascer, mas a reviravolta da guerra ocorrera',
    'havia apenas quatro anos, quando já era',
    'adulta. Discutiu com ela durante um quarto',
    'de hora talvez. No fim, conseguiu forçar-lhe',
    'a memória a recordar vagamente que, outrora,',
    'o inimigo fora a Lestásia e não a Eurásia.',
    'Todavia, isso não lhe parecia significativo.',
    '- Que importa?, indagou, impaciente., é',
    'sempre uma horrível guerra depois da outra,',
    'e a gente sabe que o noticiário é todo',
    'falso mesmo. às vezes ele lhe falava do',
    'Departamento de Registro e das impudentes',
    'falsificações que lá executava. Essas',
    'coisas não pareciam horrorizá-la. Não',
    'sentia o abismo abrindo-se aos seus pés,',
    'ao pensar nas mentiras que se transformavam',
    'em verdades. Ele contou-lhe a história',
    'de Jones, Aaronson e Rutherford, e do momentoso',
    'papelzinho que um dia tivera entre os dedos.',
    'Não a impressionou grandemente. Na verdade,',
    'a princípio, ela nem compreendeu a situação.',
    '- Eram teus amigos?, Não, nunca os conheci.',
    'Eram membros do Partido Interno. Além disso,',
    'eram muito mais velhos do que eu. Pertênciam',
    'ao passado, vinham de antes da Revolução.',
    'Eu mal os conhecia de vista., Então por',
    'que te preocupas? Não vivem matando gente',
    'o tempo todo? Tentou fazê-la compreender.',
    '- Foi um caso excepcional. Não foi apenas',
    'um assassínio. Percebes que o passado,',
    'a partir de ontem, foi abolido? Se sobrevive',
    'nalguma parte, é em alguns objetos sólidos,',
    'sem palavras ligadas a ele, como naquele',
    'pedaço de vidro. Já não sabemos quase',
    'nada sobre a Revolução e os anos anteriores',
    'à Revolução. Todos os registros foram',
    'destruidos ou falsificados, todo livro reescrito,',
    'todo quadro repintado, toda estátua, rua',
    'e edifício rebatizado, toda data alterada.',
    'E o processo continua, dia a dia, minuto',
    'a minuto. A história parou. Nada existe,',
    'exceto um presente sem-fim no qual o Partido',
    'tem sempre razão. Eu sei, naturalmente,',
    'que o passado é falsificado, mas jamais',
    'me seria possível prová-lo, mesmo sendo',
    'eu o autor da falsificação. Depois de',
    'feito o serviço, não sobram provas. A',
    'única prova está dentro da minha cabeça,',
    'e não sei com certeza se outros seres humanos',
    'partilham minhas recordações. Apenas',
    'naquele caso, em minha vida toda, possuí',
    'prova real, concreta, depois do acontecimento.',
    'anos depois., E de que adiantou?, Não',
    'adiantou nada, porque a joguei fora uns minutos',
    'depois. Porém se a mesma coisa acontecesse',
    'hoje, eu guardaria a prova., Ora, eu não!',
    'Estou disposta a correr riscos, mas só',
    'por coisas que valham a pena, não por causa',
    'de pedacinhos de papel. Que poderias fazer',
    'com o recorte, se o guardasses?, Pouca coisa,',
    'talvez. Mas era prova. Poderia ter semeado',
    'algumas dúvidas, aqui e ali, supondo que',
    'ousasse mostrá-lo a alguém. Não creio',
    'que possamos alterar coisa alguma nesta vida.',
    'Mas posso imaginar pequenos nódulos de',
    'resistência brotando aqui e ali. pequenos',
    'grupos de gente que se reune, e vão crescendo,',
    'e deixando algumas notas, de modo que a geração',
    'seguinte possa continuar a obra., Não',
    'estou interessada na próxima geração,',
    'querido. Estou ínteressada em nós. -',
    'és rebelde só da cintura para baixo -',
    'disse ele. Ela achou esta frase excepcionalmente',
    'jocosa e atirou os braços em tôrno dele,',
    'deliciada. Tampouco tinha Júlia o menor',
    'interêsse pelas ramificações da doutrina',
    'do Partido. Sempre que ele começava a falardos',
    'princípios do Ingsoc, duplipensar, a mutabilidade',
    'do passado e a negação da realidade objetiva,',
    'e a usar palavras de Novilíngua, ela ficava',
    'aborrecida, confusa, e dizia não ter jamais',
    'prestado atenção a essas coisas. Sabia',
    'que era tudo lixo, portanto para que se preocupar',
    'com ele? Sabia quando aplaudir e quando vaiar,',
    'e era toda a ciência de que precisava.',
    'Quando ele persistia em falar de tais assuntos,',
    'Júlia tinha o hábito desconcertante de',
    'adormecer. Era uma dessas pessoas que podem',
    'adormecer a qualquer momento, em qualquer',
    'posição. Falando com ela, Winston percebeu',
    'como era fácil aparentar ortodoxia, sem',
    'ter a menor noção do que fosse ortodoxia.',
    'De certo modo, o ponto de vista do Partido',
    'se impunha com mais êxito às pessoas',
    'incapazes de compreendê-lo. Aceitavam as',
    'mais flagrantes violações da realidade',
    'porque jamais percebiam inteiramente a enormidade',
    'do que se lhes exigia, e não estavam suficientemente',
    'interessadas para observar o que acontecia.',
    'Graças à falta de compreensão permaneciam',
    'sãs de juizo. Apenas enguliam tudo, e o',
    'que enguliam não lhes fazia mal, porque',
    'não deixava resíduo, do mesmo modo que',
    'um grão de milho passa, sem ser digerido,',
    'pelo corpo de uma ave. 14 Por fim acontecera.',
    'Chegara a esperada mensagem. Pareceu-lhe',
    'que a vida toda estivera esperando aquilo.',
    'Caminhava pelo longo corredor do Ministério',
    'e estava quase no local onde Júlia lhe',
    'metera o bilhete na mão quando percebeu',
    'que o seguía alguém, mais encorpado que',
    'ele. Essa pessoa, fosse quem fosse, tossiu',
    'um pouco, como um prelúdio à fala. Winston',
    'parou abruptamente e voltou-se. Era O\'Brien.',
    'Afinal encontravam-se face a face, e pareceu-lhe',
    'que o seu único impulso era fugir. O coração',
    'martelava furiosamente. Não conseguiria',
    'falar. O\'Brien, todavia, continuara no mesmo',
    'movimento, colocando a mão por um momento',
    'no braço de Winston, de modo que agora',
    'caminhavam lado a lado. Começou a falar',
    'com a solene cortesia característica que',
    'tanto o diferenciava da maioria dos membros',
    'do Partido Interno., Tinha esperança de',
    'poder-te falar, disse., Li outro dia no',
    'Times um teu artigo em Novilíngua. Tens',
    'um interesse de erudito na Novilíngua,',
    'não é? Winston recuperara um pouco do',
    'seu auto-controle., Erudito, não. Sou',
    'um mero amador. Não é o meu forte. Nunca',
    'tive nenhuma interferência na construção',
    'do idioma., Mas o escreves com muita elegância',
    '- insistiu O\'Brien., E não é apenas',
    'minha opinião. Recentemente, conversei',
    'com um amigo teu, que é um perito. No momento,',
    'foge-me da memória o nome dele. O coração',
    'de Winston tornou a pular, doloridamente.',
    'Era inconcebível que aquelas palavras não',
    'fossem referência a Syme. Porém Syme',
    'não estava apenas morto, fora abolido,',
    'era uma impessoa. Seria mortalmente perigoso',
    'fazer-lhe uma referência identificável.',
    'A observação de O\'Brien deveria, evidentemente,',
    'ser tomada como sinal, código. Dividindo',
    'uma pequena crimidéia, os dois tornavam-se',
    'cúmplices. Tinham continuado pelo corredor,',
    'mas de repente O\'Brien se deteve. Com a amistosidade',
    'curiosa e desarmante que sempre lograva comunicar',
    'ao gesto, recolocou os óculos no nariz.',
    'E continuou:, O que eu de fato queria te',
    'dizer, a propósito do artigo, é que notei',
    'o uso de duas palavras obsoletas. Que se',
    'tornaram obsoletas muito recentemente. Já',
    'viste a décima edição do Dicionário',
    'de Novilíngua? Não. Não creio que já',
    'tenha sido publicado. No Departamento de',
    'Registro ainda usamos a nona., Creio que',
    'a décima edição só será publicada',
    'daqui a alguns meses. Mas foram preparados',
    'alguns exemplares especiais, de amostra.',
    'E eu recebi um. Talvez gostasses de examiná-lo?',
    '- Apreciaria imenso, disse Winston, percebendo',
    'imediatamente aonde levava a conversa. Algumas',
    'novidades são muito engenhosas. A redução',
    'do número de verbos, por exemplo. creio',
    'que gostarás de ver isso. Vejamos, mando-te',
    'um mensageiro te entregar o dicionário?',
    'O pior é que invariàvelmente me esqueço',
    'de tudo. O melhor, talvez, seria ires buscá-lo',
    'no meu apartamento, à hora que quisesses.',
    'Espera, que já te dou meu enderêço.',
    'Estavam parados diante duma teletela. Um',
    'tanto distraido, O\'Brien procurou em dois',
    'bolsos e deles tirou um pequeno canhenho',
    'de capa de couro e uma lapiseira-tinta, de',
    'ouro. Logo abaixo da teletela, em posição',
    'tal que pudesse ser lido por quem estivesse',
    'de plantão no outro extremo do fio do aparelho,',
    'ele rabiscou um enderêço, arrancou a',
    'página e deu a Winston., Em geral estou',
    'em casa à noite, disse ele., Se não',
    'estiver, minha empregada te entregará o',
    'Dicionário. E afastou-se, deixando Winston',
    'com o pedaço de papel que, desta vez, não',
    'havia necessidade de esconder. Não obstante,',
    'decorou-o cuidadosamente e algumas horas',
    'mais tarde jogou-o no buraco da memória,',
    'com um maço de outros papéis. Tinham',
    'conversado um par de minutos, no máximo.',
    'O episódio só podia ter um significado.',
    'Fora engendrado como meio de dar a Winston',
    'o enderêço de O\'Brien. Isto era necessário',
    'porque, exceto pela pergunta direta, não',
    'era nunca possível descobrir onde morava',
    'uma pessoa. Não havia guias nem indicadores',
    'de espécie alguma. "Se queres me ver, podes',
    'me encontrar aqui," era o sentido da mensagem',
    'de O\'Brien. Talvez até houvesse um recado',
    'oculto no Dicionário. Fosse como fosse,',
    'uma coisa era certa. A conspiração com',
    'que sonhava existia, e ele alcançara a',
    'sua periferia. Sabia que mais cedo ou mais',
    'tarde obedeceria ao chamado de O\'Brien. Talvez',
    'amanhã, talvez após longa espera. não',
    'tinha certeza. O que estava acontecendo era',
    'apenas o desenvolvimento de um processo iniciado',
    'muitos anos antes. O primeiro passo fora',
    'um pensamento secreto, involuntário, o',
    'segundo fora o início do diário. Passara',
    'das idéias às palavras, e agora das palavras',
    'aos atos. O último passo era algo que teria',
    'lugar no Ministério do Amor. Ele o aceitara.',
    'O fim estava contido no comêço. Mas era',
    'assustador; ou mais exatamente, era um prenúncio',
    'de morte, como se estivesse menos vivo. Até',
    'mesmo falando com O\'Brien, um tiritar de',
    'frio se apossara do corpo de Winston, quando',
    'o significado das palavras calou. Tivera',
    'a sensação de pisar na terra úmida',
    'de um túmulo, e não era consôlo algum',
    'saber que o túmulo lá estava, à sua',
    'espera. 15 Winston acordara com os olhos',
    'rasos dágua. Júlia rolou sonolenta para',
    'ele, murmurando algo que poderia ser Que',
    'foi? Sonhei, começou ele. E calou-se.',
    'Era complexo demais para traduzi-lo em palavras.',
    'Havia o sonho em si e havia, ligada a ele,',
    'uma lembrança consciente, que penetrara',
    'no seu espírito alguns segundos depois',
    'de acordar. Deixou-se ficar de costas, olhos',
    'fechados, ainda embebido da atmosfera do',
    'sonho. Era um vasto sonho luminoso em que',
    'toda a sua vida parecia estirar-se diante',
    'dele como uma paisagem numa tarde de verão,',
    'depois da chuva. Tudo acontecera dentro do',
    'pêso de papel, mas a superfície do vidro',
    'era a abóbada celeste, e dentro da abóbada',
    'estava tudo inundado de luz clara e suave',
    'na qual se podia enxergar distâncias intermináveis.',
    'O sonho também estava incluido, com efeito,',
    'de certo modo consistira nisso, por um gesto',
    'do braço feito por sua mãe, e repetido',
    'trinta anos mais tarde pela judía que vira',
    'no cinema, tentando proteger o filhinho contra',
    'as balas, antes que os helicópteros fizessem',
    'explodir os dois., Sabes, perguntou, que',
    'até êste momento eu acreditava ter a\'ssassinado',
    'minha mãe?, Por que a assassinaste? -',
    'indagou Júlia, quase a dormir., Não',
    'a assassinei. Não fisicamente. No sonho,',
    'recordara-se da sua última visão da mãe,',
    'e alguns minutos após despertar havia voltado',
    'à mente um bando de pequenos acontecimentos',
    'com ela relacionados. Era uma lembrança',
    'que ele devia ter deliberadamente excluido',
    'da consciência durante muitos anos. Não',
    'tinha certeza da data, mas não podia ter',
    'menos de dez anos, talvez doze, quando sucedera.',
    'O pai sumira havia algum tempo; quanto tempo',
    'antes, não podia precisar. Lembrava-se',
    'melhor das circunstâncias agoniadas da',
    'época: os pânicos periódicos dos ataques',
    'aéreos, a corrida às estações do',
    'trem subterrâneo, as pilhas de escombros',
    'por toda parte, as proclamações ininteligíveis',
    'pregadas nas esquinas, os bandos de rapazes',
    'todos de camisa da mesma cor, as filas enormes',
    'diante das padarias, o metralhar intermitente',
    'na distância, e acima de tudo, o fato',
    'de nunca haver o bastante para comer. Lembrava-se',
    'de longas tardes passadas com outros meninos',
    'remexendo em latas de lixo e montes de refugo,',
    'catando os talos de folhas de repolho, cascas',
    'de batatas, às vezes até pedaços de',
    'côdea de pão velho que limpavam cuidadosamente',
    'das cinzas. e também da espera da passagem',
    'de caminhões que faziam determinado itinerário,',
    'carregando comida para o gado e que, sacolejando',
    'nos trechos de mau calçamento, às vezes',
    'derrubavam fragmentos de torta de algodão.',
    'Quando o pai desapareceu, sua mãe não',
    'demonstrou nenhuma surpresa ou mágua violenta,',
    'porém uma repentina mudança a acometeu.',
    'Parecia ter perdido a fibra. Era evidente,',
    'até para Winston, que ela esperava algo',
    'que deveria acontecer. Fazia todo o necessário',
    '- cozinhava, lavava, remendava, fazia a cama,',
    'varria, espanava, sempre muito devagar e',
    'com uma curiosa economia de gestos supérfluos,',
    'como uma figura criada por um artista e que',
    'se movesse por si mesma. O corpo grande e',
    'bem proporcionado pareceu cair num marasmo',
    'natural. Durante horas a fio ficava sentada',
    'quase imóvel na cama, cuidando da filhinha,',
    'uma criança miúda, enfermiça, muito',
    'calada, de dois ou três anos, e a quem',
    'a magreza dera feições de símio. De',
    'raro em raro, tomava Winston nos braços',
    'e apertava-o contra o seio longo tempo, sem',
    'dizer nada. E ele percebia, apesar da pouca',
    'idade e do seu egoismo, que esta atitude',
    'era ligada a uma coisa imencionável que',
    'não tardaria a ocorrer. Lembrava-se do',
    'quarto em que moravam, um aposento escuro,',
    'abafado, que parecia cheio, pela metade,',
    'com uma cama de cabeceira branca. Na guarda',
    'da lareira havia um fogareiro a gás, e',
    'uma prateleira onde ficavam os gêneros.',
    'No patamar, fora do quarto, havia uma pia',
    'de louça marrom, comum a várias famílias.',
    'Lembrava-se do corpo estatuesco de sua mãe,',
    'inclinado sobre o fogareiro, mexendo a caçarola.',
    'Sobretudo lembrava-se da sua fome contínua,',
    'e das brigas encarniçadas e sórdidas',
    'às refeições. Perguntava a sua mãe,',
    'chocarreiramente, milhares de vezes, porque',
    'não havia mais comida, gritava e esbravejava',
    'com ela (recordava-se até dos tons de sua',
    'voz, que estava começando a mudar prematuramente',
    'e de vez em quando reboava de maneira especial),',
    'ou tentava uma nota patética e nasal, num',
    'esfôrço de ganhar mais que o seu quinhão.',
    'E ela estava disposta a darlhe mais que o',
    'quinhão. Considerava natural que ele, "o',
    'rapaz", recebesse a maior porção; por',
    'mais que lhe desse, porém, ele invariàvelmente',
    'pedia mais. Em cada refeição ela lhe',
    'pedia que não fosse egoista e lembrasse',
    'que a irmãzinha doente também precisava',
    'de alimento, mas era inútil. Ele chorava',
    'de raiva quando a mãe parava de servi-lo,',
    'tentava arrancar-lhe das mãos a caçarola',
    'e a colher, furtava bocados do prato da irmã.',
    'Sabia que assim as condenava à fome, mas',
    'não podia evitá-lo; sentia-se até com',
    'direito a agir dessa forma. A fome clamorosa',
    'que tinha na barriga parecia justificá-lo.',
    'Entre as refeições, se a mãe não',
    'vigiasse, ele constantemente pilhava as magras',
    'provisões da prateleira. Um dia, foi distribuida',
    'uma ração de chocolate. Havia semanas',
    'ou meses que não se via chocolate. Winston',
    'lembrava-se com muita clareza daquele precioso',
    'pedacinho de chocolate. Era uma barra de',
    'duas onças (naquele tempo ainda se falava',
    'em onças) para os três.\' Evidentemente,',
    'devia ser dívidida em três partes iguais.',
    'De repente, como se ouvisse a voz de outrem,',
    'ele se ouviu exigindo, com voz grossa e forte,',
    'que lhe dessem a barra toda. A mãe respondeu-lhe',
    'que não fosse guloso. Houve uma longa e',
    'incômoda discussão, que durou horas,',
    'com gritos, uivos, lágrimas, queixas, acordos.',
    'A irmãzinha, agarrada à mãe com as',
    'duas mãos, exatamente como um filhote de',
    'macaco, olhava-o com grandes olhos doridos.',
    'Por fim, a mãe quebrou a barra em quatro',
    'pedaços iguais, dando três a Winston',
    'e o último à menina. A garota apanhou',
    'e ficou a olhá-lo, feito água parada,',
    'talvez sem saber o que fosse. Winston observou-a',
    'um momento. Depois, com um bote repentino',
    'e célere, arrancou o pedaço de chocolate',
    'da mão da irmã e correu para a porta.',
    '- Winston, Winston!, chamou sua mãe. -',
    'Volta e devolve o chocolate da tua irmã!',
    'Ele parou, mas não voltou. Os olhos ansiosos',
    'de sua mãe o fixavam. Naquele momento ela',
    'estava pensando na coisa que ele não sabia',
    'o que fosse, mas que deveria acontecer. A',
    'menina, consciente de ter sido furtada, gemia',
    'dèbilmente. A mulher passou o braço em',
    'tôrno da filha e apertou-lhe o rosto contra',
    'o peito. Naquele gesto havia algo que revelou',
    'a Winston: sua irmã estava morrendo. Fez',
    'meia-volta e disparou escada abaixo, o chocolate',
    'a melar-lhe os dedos. Nunca mais tornara',
    'a ver a mãe. Depois de devorar o chocolate,',
    'sentira-se um tanto envergonhado de si mesmo',
    'e ficara na rua várias horas, até a fome',
    'lhe indicar o caminho de casa. Quando chegou,',
    'a mãe desaparecera. Naquela época, isso',
    'já-se estava tornando normal. Nada sumira',
    'do quarto, exceto a mulher e a filha. Não',
    'tinham levado roupa alguma, nem mesmo o capote',
    'da mãe. Até aquele dia, Winston não',
    'sabia com certeza se ela estava morta ou',
    'não. Era perfeitamente possível que a',
    'tivessem apenas enviado a uma colonia correcional.',
    'Quanto à irmã, poderia ter sido mandada,',
    'como Winston, a um dos orfanatos surgidos',
    'em consequência da guerra civil; ou podia',
    'ter sido levada para o campo com sua mãe,',
    'ou meramente abandonada nalguma parte, para',
    'morrer. O sonho ainda estava vívido no',
    'seu espírito, especialmente o gesto protetor',
    'do braço no qual parecia se conter todo',
    'o seu significado. Winston lembrou-se de',
    'outro sonho, de dois meses antes. Na posição',
    'exata em que sua mãe sentara na cama miseranda,',
    'de colcha branca, com a filha agarrada ao',
    'peito, ela aparecera no navio naufragado,',
    'bem abaixo dele, e afundando cada vez mais,',
    'sempre a fitá-lo através da água escura.',
    'Contou a Júlia a história do desaparecimento',
    'de sua mãe. Sem abrir os olhos, ela rolou',
    'sobre si mesma e instalou-se em posição',
    'mais confortável., Eu te vejo como uma',
    'fèrinha diabólica, naquela época -',
    'disse ela, indistintamente., Tôdas as',
    'crianças são féras., São, mas o',
    'importante da história. Pela sua respiração',
    'pausada tornou-se evidente que ela adormecera',
    'de novo. Ele gostaria de ter continuado falando',
    'da mãe. Não supunha, pelo que ainda se',
    'lembrava dela, que tivesse sido mulher fora',
    'do comum, e muito menos inteligente; e no',
    'entanto possuira uma espécie de nobreza,',
    'de pureza, simplesmente porque obedecia a',
    'cânones que eram seus próprios. Seus',
    'sentimentos eram dela mesma, e não podiam',
    'ser alterados pelas circunstâncias externas.',
    'Não lhe ocorreria que um ato ineficaz se',
    'tornaria, por isso mesmo, sem sentido. Quando',
    'se ama alguém, ama-se, e quando não se',
    'tem nada mais para lhe dar, ainda se lhe',
    'dá amor. Acabado o chocolate; a mãe agarrara',
    'a menina. Era inútil, não adiantava nada,',
    'não produzia mais chocolate, não evitava',
    'nem a morte da menina nem a sua; mas parecia-lhe',
    'natural fazê-lo. A refugiada do navio também',
    'cobrira o menininho com o braço, que não',
    'era mais defesa contra as balas do que uma',
    'folha de papel. O que o Partido fizera de',
    'terrível era persuadir os seus membros',
    'de que meros impulsos, meras sensações,',
    'não tinham importância, ao mesmo tempo',
    'que lhes roubava todo poder sobre o mundo',
    'material. Uma vez no jugo do Partido, o que',
    'a pessoa sentisse ou não, o que fizesse',
    'ou deixasse de fazer, literalmente não',
    'fazia diferença. Acontecesse o que acontecesse,',
    'o indivíduo sumia, e nem ele nem seus atos',
    'eram jamais mencionados. Era banido do rio',
    'da história. E no entanto, aos cidadãos',
    'de apenas duas gerações atrás, isto',
    'não teria parecido importante, porque não',
    'tentavam alterar a história. Eram governados',
    'por lealdades particulares que não punham',
    'em dúvida. O que importava eram relações',
    'individuais, e podia ter valor em si um gesto',
    'completamente irrelevante, um abraço, uma',
    'lágrima, uma\'palavra dita a um moribundo.',
    'De repente, ocorreu-lhe que os proles tinham',
    'continuado assim. Não eram leais a um partido,',
    'país ou ideologia, eram leais aos seus',
    'semelhantes. Pela primeira vez na vida não',
    'desprezou os proles nem pensou neles apenas',
    'como fôrça inerte que um dia ganharia',
    'vida e regeneraria o mundo. Os proles tinham',
    'continuado humanos. Não se haviam endurecido',
    'por dentro. Haviam conservado as emoções',
    'primitivas que ele próprio tivera de reaprender',
    'por esfôrço consciente. E assim raciocinando',
    'ele se lembrou, sem ligação aparente,',
    'de como vira, havia algumas semanas, uma',
    'mão amputada na rua e como a chutara para',
    'a sargeta, como se fosse um talo de couve.',
    '- Os proles são seres humanos, disse ele,',
    'em voz alta., Nós não somos humanos.',
    '- Por que?, quis saber Júlia, que acordara',
    'outra Vez. Ele meditou uns instantes., Já',
    'te ocorreu que o melhor que temos a fazer',
    'é simplesmente ir embora daqui, antes que',
    'seja tarde demais, e nunca mais nos vermos?',
    '- Sim, querido, já me ocorreu diversas',
    'vezes, Mas não, não vou sair, e pronto.',
    '- Temos tido sorte, disse ele, mas não',
    'pode durar muito tempo. és jovem. Pareces',
    'normal e inocente. Se te afastas de gente',
    'como eu, podes viver mais cinqüenta anos.',
    '- Não. Já pensei em tudo. O que fizeres,',
    'eu faço também. E não te afobes. Tenho',
    'jeito para viver., Podemos ficar juntos',
    'mais seis meses. um ano. não há maneira',
    'de saber. No fim, é certo que nos separem.',
    'Percebes como seremos solitários? Quando',
    'nos peguem, não haverá nada, literalmente',
    'nada, que possamos fazer um pelo outro. Se',
    'eu confessar, eles te fusilam, e se eu',
    'recusar confessar, te fusilam do mesmo modo.',
    'Nada que eu possa dizer ou fazer, ou proibir-me',
    'de dizer, te adiará de cinco minutos a',
    'hora da morte. Nem ao menos saberemos se',
    'o outro estará morto ou vivo. Ficaremos',
    'completamente inermes. A única coisa que',
    'importa é que não atraiçoemos um ao',
    'outro, embora nem isso faça a menor diferença.',
    '- Se te referes à confissão, ah, isso',
    'confessaremos. Todo mundo sempre confessa.',
    'Não podes evitar. eles torturam a gente.',
    '- Não, não é confessar. Confissão',
    'não é traição. O que digas ou faças',
    'não importa. O que importa são os sentimentos.',
    'Se conseguirem me obrigar a deixar de te',
    'amar. isso seria traição. Ela raciocinou.',
    '- Isso não podem fazer. é a única coisa',
    'que não podem. Podem te fazer dizer« qualquer',
    'coisa. tudo. mas não podem te obrigar',
    'a acreditar. Não penetram na gente., Não',
    '- ele concordou, um pouco mais esperançado.',
    '- é verdade. Não penetram na gente. Se',
    'podes sentir que vale a pena continuar humano,',
    'mesmo que isso não dê o menor resultado,',
    'terás vencido os torturadores. Ele pensou',
    'na teletela com seu ouvido insone. Podiam',
    'espionar o indivíduo noite e dia, mas se',
    'ele não perdesse a cabeça ainda conseguia',
    'ludibriá-los. Com toda a sua sagacidade,',
    'não tinham jamais conquistado o segrêdo',
    'de descobrir o que pensa outro ser humano.',
    'Talvez isso fosse menos verdade quando o',
    'cídadão lhe caisse nas unhas. Não se',
    'sabia o que acontecia dentro do Ministério',
    'do Amor, mas era possível adivinhar: torturas,',
    'drogas, delicados instrumentos que registravam',
    'as reações nervosas do paciente, e o',
    'desgaste gradual pela falta de sono, a solidão,',
    'o interrogatório persistente. Pelo menos,',
    'seria impossível ocultar fatos. Podiam',
    'ser encontrados pela pergunta, e arrancados',
    'pela tortura. Mas se o objetivo era não',
    'tanto continuar vivo como continuar humano,',
    'que diferença poderia fazer, no fim? Não',
    'podiam alterar os sentimentos do indivíduo:',
    'nem ele próprio o consegue, mesmo que o',
    'deseje. Podiam desnudar, nos mínimos detalhes,',
    'tudo quanto houvesse feito, dito ou pensado;',
    'mas o imo do coração, cujo funcionamento',
    'é um mistério para o próprio indivíduo,',
    'continu ava inexpugnável. 16 Haviam resolvido,',
    'por fim se haviam resolvido! A sala em que',
    'estavam era comprida e suavemente iluminada.',
    'A teletela fora reduzida a um murmúrio;',
    'a maciez e espessura do tapete azul dava',
    'a impressão de se andar no veludo. No extremo',
    'da sala, O\'Brien estava sentado a uma mesa,',
    'sob uma lâmpada de abajur verde, com um',
    'monte de papéis de cada lado. Nem se dignara',
    'levantar o olhar quando o criado introduziu',
    'Júlia e Winston. O coração de Winston',
    'batia com tanta fôrça que duvidava poder',
    'falar. Haviam resolvido, haviam-se resolvido',
    'afinal, era tudo que conseguia pensar. Fôra',
    'ousadia ir à casa de O\'Brien, e pura loucura',
    'chegar à sua porta com Júlia; embora',
    'fosse verdade que tivessem ido por caminhos',
    'diferentes apenas se encontrando diante da',
    'porta. Mas era preciso muita coragem e esfôrço',
    'nervoso para entrar num lugar dêsses. Só',
    'em ocasiões muito raras se viam por dentro',
    'as residências do Partido Interno, ou se',
    'visitava o bairro em que moravam os chefes.',
    'Tôda a atmosfera do enorme edifício de',
    'apartamentos, a riqueza e a vastidão de',
    'tudo, os cheiros fora do comum de boa comida',
    'e bom fumo, os elevadores silenciosos e incrivelmente',
    'rápidos, disparando para cima e para baixo,',
    'os criados de jaqueta branca, sempre apressados',
    '- era tudo intimidante. Embora Winston tivesse',
    'um bom pretexto de ali estar, a cada passo',
    'assombrava-o o medo de que um guarda de farda',
    'negra aparecesse de repente, ao dobrar uma',
    'esquina, exigisse seus papéis e o mandasse',
    'embora. O criado de O\'Brien, porém, admitira',
    'os dois sem titubear. Era um homenzinho de',
    'cabelo escuro,paletó branco, cara losangular,',
    'inteiramente sem expressão, e que poderia',
    'passar por chinês. O corredor pelo qual',
    'os guiou era atapetado, e tinha paredes creme,',
    'com rodapé branco, tudo imaculadamente',
    'limpo. Era de dar medo. Winston não se',
    'lembrava de ter visto um corredor cujas paredes',
    'não fossem marcadas da sujeira do contacto',
    'de corpos humanos. O\'Brien tinha um pedaço',
    'de papel entre os dedos e parecia estudá-lo',
    'atentamente. O rosto largo, inclinado de',
    'modo que se podia ver a linha do naríz,',
    'parecia ao mesmo tempo formidável e inteligente.',
    'Dur ante talvez vinte segundos ele continuou',
    'imóvel. Depois puxou o falascreve para',
    'perto e ditou um recado no jargão híbrido',
    'dos Ministérios:, Itens um vírgula cinco',
    'vírgula sete aprovados completos ponto',
    'sugestão contida item seis dupliplus ridícula',
    'quase crimidéia cancelar pontos incontinuar',
    'construtivo anteobtendo pluscompleto orçamento',
    'máquinas extracustos ponto fim mensagem.',
    'Levantou-se deliberadamente da cadeira e',
    'aproximou-se deles, sem ruido, andando pelo',
    'tapete espesso. Com as palavras em Novilíngua,',
    'parecia ter deixado para trás um pouco',
    'da sua atmosfera oficial, porém a sua catadura',
    'era mais fechada do que de costume, como',
    'se estivesse aborrecido com a interrupção.',
    'Ao terror que Winston já sentia misturou-se',
    'de repente um traço de embaraço comum.',
    'Pareceu-lhe perfeitamente possível que',
    'houvesse cometido um êrro estúpido. Na',
    'verdade que prova tinha de que O\'Brien fosse',
    'um conspirador político? Nada, além de',
    'uma chispa no olhar e uma única observação',
    'equívoca: fora isso, só a sua imaginação',
    'secreta, fundada num sonho. Não podia ao',
    'menos fingir que fora pedir o Dicionário',
    'emprestado, pois nesse caso seria impossível',
    'explicar a presença de Júlia. Quando',
    'O\'Brien passou pela teletela, um pensamento',
    'pareceu vir-lhe à mente. Deteve-se, voltou-se',
    'e apertou um comutador na parede. Houve um',
    'estalido sêco e a voz parou. Júlia soltou',
    'uma pequena exclamação, uma espécie',
    'de guincho de surpresa. Mesmo em meio ao',
    'seu pânico, Winston ficou tão admirado',
    'que não pôde deixar de exclamar:, Desligou',
    'a teletela!, Sim, disse O\'Brien, desliguei.',
    'Nós temos êsse privilégio. Estava na',
    'frente deles. O corpanzil sólido dominava',
    'o casal, e a expressão fisionômica continuava',
    'indecifrável. Estava esperando, severo,',
    'que Winston falasse, mas do que? Era bem',
    'concebível que não passasse de um homem',
    'ocupado, surpreendido e irritado com a interrupção.',
    'Ninguém falou. Depois de calar-se a teletela',
    'a sala parecia quieta como um túmulo. Os',
    'segundos passaram, enornes. Com dificuldade,',
    'Winston continuava a fixar seus olhos nos',
    'de O\'Brien. De repente, a carranca se dissolveu',
    'no que poderia ser o começo dum sorriso.',
    'Com seu gesto característico, O\'Brien recolocou',
    'os óculos no nariz., Falo eu, ou falas',
    'tu?, Eu falo, ofereceu-se Winston prontamente.',
    '- Aquilo está mesmo desligado?, Está.',
    'Tudo desligado. Estamos sós., Viemos aqui',
    'porque. Fez uma pausa, percebendo pela',
    'primeira vez como eram vagos os seus motivos.',
    'Como não sabia que espécie de auxílio',
    'esperava de O\'Brien, não era fácil dizer',
    'a que fora. Continuou, consciente de que',
    'suas palavras deviam parecer fracas e pretenciosas:',
    '- Acreditamos que existe alguma conspiração,',
    'alguma organização secreta trabalhando',
    'contra o Partido, e que estás envolvido',
    'nela. Queremos também trabalhar nela. Somos',
    'inimigos do Partido. Não acreditamos nos',
    'princípios do Ingsoc. Somos ideocriminosos.',
    'Também somos adúlteros. Conto tudo isto',
    'porque queremos nos entregar à tua mercê.',
    'Se queres incriminar-nos de qualquer outra',
    'forma, estamos prontos. Calou-se e olhou',
    'sobre o ombro, com a impressão de que a',
    'porta se abrira. De fato, o criado de cara',
    'amarela surgira sem bater. Winston viu que',
    'ele trazia uma bandeja com um frasco de cristal',
    'e copos., Martin é dos nossos, disse',
    'O\'Brien, impassível., Traz a bebida aqui,',
    'Martin. Põe a bandeja na mesa redonda.',
    'Temos cadeiras suficientes? Então sentemos',
    'e conversemos comodamente. Traz uma cadeira',
    'para ti, Martin. Falamos de negócios. Podes',
    'deixar de ser criado durante dez minutos.',
    'O homenzinho sentou-se, completamente à',
    'vontade, e no entanto ainda com ar de servo,',
    'o ar de um criado de quarto que goza de um',
    'privilégio. Winston considerou-o de soslaio.',
    'Ocorreu- lhe que a vida toda do homem era',
    'desempenhar um papel, e que achava perigoso',
    'abandonar, por um momento que fosse, sua',
    'falsa personalidade. O\'Brien tomou a garrafa',
    'de cristal pelo pescoço e encheu os copos',
    'com um líquido vermelho escuro. Provocou',
    'em Winston vagas memórias de algo que vira',
    'havia muito tempo numa parede ou num tapume',
    '- uma vasta garrafa, composta de luzes que',
    'pareciam borbulhar e despejar o conteúdo',
    'num copo. Visto de cima, o líquido parecia',
    'quase negro, mas no frasco brilhava como',
    'um rubi. Tinha um cheiro agri-doce. Viu Júlia',
    'apanhar o copo e cheirá-lo com cândida',
    'curiosidade., Chama-se vinho, informou',
    'O\'Brien, com a sombra dum sorriso., Sem',
    'dúvida leste a respeito do vinho, nos livros.',
    'Mas não são muitos do Partido Externo',
    'que o conhecem., O rosto solenizou-se de',
    'novo, e ele ergueu o copo:, Creio que devemos',
    'beber um brinde. à saúde do nosso chefe,',
    'Emmanuel Goldstein. Winston agarrou o copo',
    'com certa ânsia. Vinho era algo com que',
    'sonhára e sobre o qual lera. Como o pêso',
    'de papel ou as cantigas semi-esquecidas do',
    'sr. Charrington, pertencia ao passado, desaparecido',
    'e romântico, o tempo de dantes, como gostava',
    'de chamá-lo secretamente, nos seus pensamentos.',
    'Sem saber por que motivo, sempre acreditara',
    'que o vinho tinha sabor intensamente doce,',
    'como de geléia de amora, e um efeito inebriante',
    'imediato. Mas quando o enguliu, a bebida',
    'lhe causou uma decepção. A verdade èra',
    'que, depois de beber gin durante anos, mal',
    'podia prová-lo. Depôs na mesa o copo',
    'vazio., Então Goldstein existe?, Sim,',
    'existe, e está vivo. Onde, não sei. -',
    'E a conspiração. a organização?',
    'Existe? Não é mera invenção da Polícia',
    'do Pensamento?, Existe, sim. Chama-se a',
    'Fraternidade. Nunca saberás muito mais',
    'a respeito da Fraternidade, exceto que existe',
    'e que pertences a ela. Voltarei ao assunto',
    'daqui a pouco., Olhou o relógio-pulseira.',
    '- é imprudente, mesmo para os membros do',
    'Partido Interno, desligar a teletela mais',
    'de meia-hora. Não devias ter vindo com',
    'a moça, e tereis de sair separados. Tu,',
    'camarada, e índicou Júlia com a cabeça',
    '- sairás antes. Temos uns vinte minutos',
    'à nossa disposição. Compreendeis que',
    'devo fazer algumas perguntas. Em termos gerais,',
    'a que estais dispostos?, A qualquer coisa',
    'de que formos capazes, respondeu Winston.',
    'O\'Brien voltara-se um pouco na cadeira, de',
    'modo que estava de frente a Winston. Quase',
    'não considerava Júlia, parecendo achar',
    'que Winston falava por ela. Piscou repetidamente,',
    'e começou a fazer as perguntas em voz baixa,',
    'sem expressão como se fosse uma rotina,',
    'uma espécie de catecismo, cujas respostas',
    'já lhe fossem conhecidas., Estás disposto',
    'a dar a vida?, Estou., Estás disposto',
    'a assassinar?, Estou., A cometer atos de',
    'sabotagem que poderão causar a morte de',
    'centenas de inocentes?, Sim., A trair tua',
    'pátria às potências estrangeiras? -',
    'Sim., Estás disposto a fraudar, forjar,',
    'fazer chantagem, corromper a mente infantil,',
    'distribuir entorpecentes, incentivar a prostituição,',
    'disseminar dôenças venéreas, fazer',
    'tudo quanto possa causar a desmoralização',
    'e debilitar o poder do Partido?, Sim. -',
    'Se, por exemplo, servisse aos nossos interesses',
    'atirar ácido sulfúrico no rosto duma',
    'criança, farias isso?, Faria, sim., Estás',
    'disposto a perder tua identidade e viver',
    'o resto da tua vida como garçon ou estivador?',
    '- Estou., Estás disposto a te suicidar,',
    'se e quando isso te for ordenado?, Sim.',
    '- Estais dispostos, os dois, a vos separardes',
    'e nunca mais vos tornardes a ver?, Não!',
    '- irrompeu Júlia. A Winston pareceu haver',
    'uma longa pausa antes de responder. Por um',
    'momento até lhe pareceu estar privado da',
    'fala. A língua movia-se sem som, formando',
    'primeiro a sílaba de uma palavra, depois',
    'de outra, inúmeras vezes. Até pronunciá-la,',
    'não sabia ao certo o que diria., Não',
    '- repetiu, por fim., Fizeste bem de me dizer',
    '- disse O\'Brien., é necessário saber',
    'tudo. Voltou-se para Júlia e acrescentou,',
    'com voz um pouco mais expressiva:, Compreendes',
    'que, mesmo que ele sobreviva, talvez seja',
    'pessoa diferente? Pode ser que tenhamos de',
    'dar-lhe nova identidade. Seu rosto, seus',
    'movimentos, a forma de suas mãos, a cor',
    'do cabelo. até a voz poderão ser diferentes.',
    'E tu também podes te transformar numa pessoa',
    'diferente. Nossos cirurgiões podem alterar',
    'as pessoas, torná-las irreconheciveis.',
    'às vezes é necessário. às vezes chegamos',
    'a amputar um membro. Winston não pôde',
    'impedir outra olhada de soslaio ao rosto',
    'mongol de Martin. Não havia cicatrizes',
    'visíveis. Júlia empalidecera um pouco,',
    'e suas sardas se destacavam mais, porém',
    'olhava O\'Brien nos olhos. Murmurou algo que',
    'parecia ser assentimento., Bom. Então',
    'está resolvido. Havia uma caixa de cigarros,',
    'de prata, sobre a mesa. Com ar distraído,',
    'O\'Brien ofereceu-a aos outros, serviu-se',
    'e depois levantou-se, pondo-se a passear',
    'de um lado para outro da sala, como se pensasse',
    'melhor de pé. Eram cigarros muito bons,',
    'bem feitos e firmes, de papel extraordinàriamente',
    'sedoso. O\'Brien tornou a olhar o relógio-pulseira.',
    '- Melhor voltares à cozinha, Martin, disse',
    'ele., Vou ligar daqui a um quarto de hora.',
    'Examina bem a cara dêstes camaradas antes',
    'de ires. Hás de revê-los. Eu talvez não.',
    'Exatamente como fizera à porta, o homenzinho',
    'de olhos escuros os fitou com firmeza. Não',
    'havia em seus modos uma fagulha de amabilidade.',
    'Estava aprendendo de cor as fisionomias,',
    'porém não sentia interesse por eles.',
    'Winston imaginou que um rosto sintético',
    'talvez fosse incapaz de mudar de expressão.',
    'Sem falar nem fazer qualquer cumprimento,',
    'Martin saiu, fechando a porta atrás de',
    'si, em silêncio. O\'Brien continuava passeando',
    'pela sala, uma das mãos no bolso do macacão',
    'negro, a outra segurando o cigarro., Compreendeis',
    'que lutareis no escuro? Estareis sempre no',
    'escuro. Recebereis ordens e obedecereis,',
    'sem saber porque. Mais tarde vos mandarei',
    'um livro do qual aprendereis a verdadeira',
    'natureza da sociedade em que vivemos, e a',
    'estratégia pela qual a destruiremos. Quando',
    'tiverdes lido o livro, sereis membros integrais',
    'da Fraternidade. Mas entre os objetivos gerais',
    'pelos quais lutamos, e as tarefas imediatas',
    'do momento, nada sabereis. Digo-vos que existe',
    'a Fraternidade, mas não posso dizer-vos',
    'se conta com cem membros, ou dez milhões.',
    'Pelo vosso conhecimento pessoal, não podereis',
    'dizer que chega a uma dúzia. Tereis três',
    'ou quatro contactos, que serão renovados',
    'de tempos em tempos, à medida que desaparecerem.',
    'Como êste foi vosso primeiro contacto,',
    'será conservado. Quando receberdes ordens,',
    'será de mim. Se considerarmos necessário',
    'comunicar-nos convosco, será por meio de',
    'Martin. Quando fordes por fim presos, confessareis.',
    'é inevitável. Mas tereis pouquíssimo',
    'para confessar, além de vossas próprias',
    'ações. Não conseguireis trair senão',
    'um punhado de gente sem importância. Provàvelmente',
    'não traireis nem a mim. A essa altura,',
    'já estarei morto, ou terei me transformado',
    'em pessoa diferente, com cara diferente.',
    'Continuou a caminhar de um lado para outro',
    'sobre o tapete macio. Apesar do volume do',
    'seu corpo, havia uma graça notável nos',
    'seus movimentos. Destacava-se até no gesto',
    'que metia a mão no bolso, ou manipulava',
    'um cigarro. Mais do que de fôrça, dava',
    'a impressão de confiança e de compreensão,',
    'colorida de ironia. Por mais sério que',
    'fosse, não tinha nada da parcialidade estreita',
    'que distingue o fanático. Quando falava',
    'de assassínio, suicídio, moléstias',
    'venéreas, membros amputados e rostos alterados,',
    'era com um ligeiro ar de zombaria. "Isto',
    'é inevitável," parecia dizer o seu tom',
    'de voz. "Isto é o que temos de fazer, sem',
    'piedade. Mas não é o que faremos quando',
    'a vida de novo valer a pena ser vivida."',
    'Uma onda de admiração, quase de adoração,',
    'fluiu de Winston. Esquecera-se da figura',
    'remota de Goldstein. Quando se olhava para',
    'os ombros poderosos de O\'Brien e sua cara',
    'de feições tão maciças, tão feia',
    'e no entanto tão civilizada, era impossível',
    'acreditar que pudesse ser derrotado. Não',
    'havia estratagema que ele não pudesse vencer,',
    'nenhum perigo que não pudesse prever. Até',
    'Júlia parecia impressionada. Deixara o',
    'cigarro apagar e agora escutava atentamente.',
    'O\'Brien continuou:, Já ouviste boatos',
    'da existência da Fraternidade. Sem dúvida',
    'já tens ídéia dela. Imaginaste, provavelmente,',
    'um vasto mundo clandestino de conspiradores,',
    'reunindo-se secretamente, em porões, rabiscando',
    'mensagens nas paredes, reconhecendo-se por',
    'meio de códigos ou gestos especiais. Nada',
    'disso existe. Os membros da Fraternidade',
    'não têm meio algum de se reconhecer e',
    'é impossível a qualquer um conhecer a',
    'identidade de mais que outros poucos. O próprio',
    'Goldstein, se caisse nas mãos da Polícia',
    'do Pensamento, não poderia fornecer uma',
    'lista completa dos conspiradores, nem informação',
    'que permitisse compilá-la. Não existe',
    'essa lista. A Fraternidade não pode ser',
    'eliminada porque não é uma organização',
    'no sentido comum da palavra. Nada a cimenta,',
    'exceto uma idéia, uma idéia indestrutível.',
    'Jamais terás nada para te sustentar, exceto,',
    'a idéia. Não terás camaradagem nem',
    'incentivo. Quando por fim fores apanhado,',
    'não terás socorro. Nunca ajudamos nossos',
    'militantes. No máximo, quando é absolutamente',
    'necessário que alguém silencíe, conseguimos',
    'às vezes meter uma lâmina de barba na',
    'cela do prêso. Terás que te acostumar',
    'a viver sem resultados e sem esperança.',
    'Trabalharás algum tempo, serás prêso,',
    'confessarás e morrerás. São os únicos',
    'resultados que verás. Não há possibilidade',
    'de se dar uma mudança perceptível durante',
    'nossa vida. Nós somos os mortos. Nossa',
    'única vida verdadeira está no futuro.',
    'Nela tomaremos parte como punhados de pó',
    'e esquírolas de ossos. Mas a que distância',
    'está êsse futuro, não há meio de',
    'saber. Pode ser daqui a mil anos. No momento,',
    'nada é possível, exceto alargar aos poucos',
    'a zona de sanidade mental. Não podemos',
    'agir coletivamente. Só podemos expandir',
    'nosso conhecimento de indivíduo a indivíduo,',
    'geração após geração. Em face da',
    'Policia do Pensamento, não há outro modo.',
    'Parou e pela terceira vez olhou para o relógio.',
    '- Já é quase hora de saires, camarada',
    '- disse a Júlia., Espera, o frasco ainda',
    'está pela metade. Encheu os copos e ergueu',
    'o seu pela haste., A que brindaremos, desta',
    'vez?, perguntou, ainda com a mesma leve',
    'sugestão de ironia., à confusão da',
    'Polícia do Pensamento? à morte do Grande',
    'Irmão? à humanidade? Ao futuro?, Ao',
    'passado, arriscou Winston., O passado é',
    'mais importante, concordou O\'Brien, gravemente.',
    'Esvaziaram os copos, e dali a um momento',
    'Júlia levantou-se. O\'Brien tirou uma caixinha',
    'do alto de um armário e deu-lhe uma pastilha',
    'branca, que recomendou dissolver na boca.',
    'Era importante, disse ele, não sair cheirando',
    'vinho: os ascensoristas eram muito observadores.',
    'Assim que a porta se fechou sobre a moça',
    'pareceu esquecer que ela existia. Deu mais',
    'uma ou duas passadas e deteve-se., Há',
    'minúcias a providenciar. Tens um esconderijo',
    'qualquer? Winston explicou que tinha o quarto',
    'da loja do sr. Charrington., Bastará,',
    'por enquanto. Mais tarde, arranjaremos algo',
    'para os dois. é importante mudar de esconderijo',
    'frequentemente. Entrementes, vou mandar-te',
    'um exemplar do livro., e Winston reparou',
    'que até O\'Brien parecia pronunciar aquela',
    'palavra como se estivesse em grifo, o livro',
    'de Goldstein, compreendes, assim que for',
    'possível. Talvez se passem alguns dias',
    'antes de eu conseguir um. Não há muitos',
    'exemplares, como podes imaginar. A Polícia',
    'do Pensamento procura-os e destrói- os',
    'quase no mesmo ritmo em que são produzidos.',
    'Faz pouca diferença, porém. O livro é',
    'indestrutível. Se o último exemplar sumisse,',
    'poderíamos reproduzi-lo quase palavra por',
    'palavra. Levas uma pasta de couro ao escritório?',
    '- indagou., Em geral, levo., Que jeito',
    'tem?, é preta, muito surrada. Com duas',
    'alças., Preta, duas alças, muito surrada.',
    'bom. Um dia, no futuro próximo, não',
    'posso fixar a data, uma das mensagens da',
    'tua tarefa matutina conterá um erro de',
    'imprensa, e terás que pedir repetição.',
    'No dia seguinte, irás à repartição',
    'sem a pasta. Nesse dia, na rua, um homem',
    'tocará teu braço e dirá "Acho que derrubaste',
    'esta pasta." E a que te entregar conterá',
    'um exemplar do livro de Goldstein. Deves',
    'devolvê-lo dentro de catorze dias. Calaram-se',
    'ambos por uns instantes., Temos um par de',
    'minutos, ainda, disse O\'Brien., Tornaremos',
    'a nos encontrar. se nos encontrarmos.',
    'Winston levantou o olhar para ele., Onde',
    'não há treva?, perguntou, hesitante.',
    'O\'Brien fez que sim, sem aparentar surpresa.',
    '- Onde não há treva, repetiu, como se',
    'reconhecesse a alusão., E agora, queres',
    'dizer alguma coisa antes de sair? Dar um',
    'recado? Fazer uma pergunta? Winston raciocinou.',
    'Não parecia haver nenhuma outra pergunta',
    'a que desejasse resposta; e menos ímpulso',
    'ainda de pronunciar generalidades altissonantes.',
    'Em vez de coisas diretamente ligadas a O\'Brien',
    'ou à Fraternidade, surgiu-lhe na mente',
    'uma espécie de figura composta do quarto',
    'escuro onde sua mãe passara os últimos',
    'dias, o quartinho por cima da loja do sr.',
    'Charrington, o pêso de papéis, e a gravura',
    'em aço na moldura de pau-rosa. Quase sem',
    'querer, perguntou:, Conheces uma cantiga',
    'muito velha que começa Laranjas e limões,',
    'dizem os sinos de S. Clemente? De novo O\'Brien',
    'fez que sim com a cabeça. Com uma espécie',
    'de grave cortesia, completou a quadra: "Laranjas',
    'e limões, dizem os sinos de S. Clemente,',
    'Me deves três vinténs, dizem os sinos',
    'de S. Martinho, Quando me pagarás? dizem',
    'os sinos de Old Bailey, Quando eu ficar rico,',
    'dizem os sinos de Shoreditch.", Sabes o',
    'último verso!, exclamou Winston., Sei,',
    'sim. E agora, creio que é hora de te retirares.',
    'Espera um pouco. é melhor te dar uma destas',
    'pastilhas. Quando Winston se levantou, O\'Brien',
    'estendeu a manopla. Apertou-lhe a mão com',
    'fôrça, quase quebrando os ossos de Winston.',
    'De saída, olhou para trás, mas O\'Brien',
    'já parecia estar entregue à tarefa de',
    'bani-lo do seu espírito. Estava esperando,',
    'com a mão no comutador da teletela. Por',
    'trás dele, eram visíveis a escrivaninha',
    'com o abajur verde, o falascreve e as cestas',
    'de arame cheias de papéis. O incidente',
    'estava encerrado. Dali a trinta segundos,',
    'O\'Brien mergulharia no seu trabalho interrompido',
    'e de grande importância para o Partido.',
    '17 Winston estava gelatinoso de cansaço.',
    'Gelatinoso era a palavra certa. Ocorreu-lhe',
    'espontâneamente. O corpo parecia ter não',
    'apenas a debilidade da gelatina, como a sua',
    'translucidez. Tinha a impressão de que,',
    'se erguesse a mão, conseguiria ver a luz',
    'do outro lado. Todo o sangue e a linfa se',
    'haviam esgotado, num imenso deboche de trabalho,',
    'deixando apenas uma frágil estrutura de',
    'nervos, ossos e pele. Tôdas as sensações',
    'pareciam ampliadas. O macacão roçava-lhe',
    'os ombros, a calçada comichava-lhe sob',
    'os pés, e até abrir e fechar a mão',
    'era um esfôrço que fazia as juntas estralarem.',
    'Em cinco dias, trabalhara mais de noventa',
    'horas. E o mesmo acontecera com todo mundo',
    'no Ministério. Agora, estava tudo acabado',
    'e, literalmente, não havia mais o que fazer,',
    'nenhuma tarefa do Partido até o dia seguinte,',
    'pela manhã. Podia passar seis horas no',
    'esconderijo e nove na própria cama. Lentamente,',
    'à luz do sol moderado daquela tarde, tomou',
    'por uma rua suja, na direção da loja',
    'do sr. Charrington, sempre de olho no aparecimento',
    'de alguma patrulha, porém irracionalmente',
    'convencido de que aquele dia não havia',
    'perigo de que o detivessem. A pesada pasta',
    'que levava chocava-se contra seus joelhos',
    'a cada passo, provocando uma sensação',
    'de formigamento na perna. Dentro dela estava',
    'o livro, que já estava em seu poder havia',
    'seis dias, e que ainda não conseguira abrir,',
    'nem mesmo olhar. No sexto dia da Semana do',
    'ódio, depois das passeatas, discursos,',
    'gritaria, cantoria, bandeiras, cartazes,',
    'filmes, esculturas em cera, rufar de tambores',
    'e guinchar de clarins, reboar de pés em',
    'marcha, ronco das esteiras dos tanques, zumbido',
    'dos aviões no ar, troar dos canhões -',
    'depois de seis dias de atividade, quando',
    'o grande orgasmo se aproximava trêmulo',
    'do clímax e o ódío geral contra a Eurásia',
    'se condensara em tamanho delírio que a',
    'multidão teria certamente esquartejado',
    'com as unhas os doís mil prisioneiros de',
    'guerra eurasianos cujo enforcamento público',
    'se realizaria no último dia, exatamente',
    'nesse momento, fora anunciado que a Oceania',
    'não estava em guerra com a Eurásia. Estava',
    'em guerra com a Lestásia. A Eurásia era',
    'aliada. Evidentemente, não se admitiu modificação',
    'alguma. Apenas se fez saber, com extrema',
    'inesperabilidade e em tôda parte ao mesmo',
    'tempo, que a inimiga era a Lestásia e não',
    'a Eurásia. Winston estava participando',
    'de uma demonstração numa praça central',
    'de Londres quando o fato ocorreu. Era noite,',
    'e os rostos brancos e as bandeiras escarlates',
    'estavam banhadas na luz dos refletores. A',
    'praça fora tomada por vários milhares',
    'de pessoas, inclusive um bloco de mil escolares',
    'com o uniforme dos Espiões. Na plataforma',
    'enfeitada de vermelho arengava à massa',
    'um orador do Partido Interno, homenzinho',
    'magro com braços desproporcionadamente',
    'longos, e uma cabeçorra calva sobre a qual',
    'dançavam algumas melenas. Figura de um',
    'conto fantástico, contorcido de ódio,',
    'agarrava com uma das mãos o pescoço do',
    'microfone, enquanto com a outra, enorme no',
    'extremo do braço ossudo, gadunhava o ar,',
    'ameaçadoramente. A voz, metalizada pelos',
    'amplificadores, catalogava incessantemente',
    'atrocidades, massacres, deportações,',
    'pilhagens, violações, tortura de prisioneiros,',
    'bombardeio de civis, propaganda mentirosa,',
    'agressões injustas, tratados desrespeitados.',
    'Era quase impossível escutá-lo sem se',
    'deixar convencer, primeiro, e depois enlouquecer.',
    'Com intervalo de alguns momentos a fúria',
    'da multidão fervia e a voz do orador era',
    'afogada por um rugido feroz, selvagem, subindo',
    'incontrolável de milhares de gargantas.',
    'Os berros mais selvagens eram os dos escolares.',
    'Havia uns vinte minutos que falava quando',
    'um mensageiro subiu à plataforma e um pedaço',
    'de papel foi passado às mãos do demagogo.',
    'Ele desenrolou-o sem parar; nada se alterou',
    'na sua voz, nem nos gestos, nem no conteúdo',
    'do que dizia. Mas de repente mudaram os nomes.',
    'Sem que uma palavra fosse pronunciada nesse',
    'sentido, uma onda de compreensão percorreu',
    'a massa. A Oceania estava em guerra com a',
    'Lestásia! No momento seguinte houve uma',
    'tremenda comoção. As faixas, bandeiras',
    'e cartazes que adornavam a praça estavam',
    'todos errados! Cerca da metade ostentava',
    'caras erradas! Era sabotagem! Os agentes',
    'de Goldstein tinham agido! Houve um ruidoso',
    'interlúdio durante o qual os cartazes foram',
    'arrancados das paredes, as bandeiras rasgadas',
    'e pisadas. Os Espiões executaram proezas',
    'admiráveis, marinhando sobre os telhados',
    'e cortando as faixas presas às chaminés.',
    'Dentro de um minuto ou dois tudo acabou.',
    'O orador, ainda agarrado ao microfone, ombros',
    'arcados para frente, a mão enorme ainda',
    'ameaçando, continuara o discurso. Dali',
    'a um minuto, os urros de féra da multidão',
    'furiosa de novo rasgaram os ares. O ódio',
    'continuou exatamente como antes. Apenas o',
    'alvo fora mudado. Em retrospecto, o que impressionara',
    'Winston, fora ter o orador passado de um',
    'inimigo a outro no meio da frase, não apenas',
    'sem pausa: sem a menor ofensa à sintaxe.',
    'Mas, no momento, tivera outras coisas a preocupá-lo.',
    'Fôra no momento exato das desordens que',
    'um homem, cujo rosto não pôde ver, lhe',
    'deu um tapinha no ombro e disse: "Desculpe,',
    'acho que derrubaste tua pasta." , E Winston',
    'a tomara distraido, sem falar. Sabia que',
    'alguns dias se passariam, sem oportunidade',
    'de abri-la. No instante em que a demonstração',
    'acabara, fora direto ao Ministério da Verdade,',
    'embora já fosse quase vinte e três horas.',
    'Todo o pessoal do Ministério fizera o mesmo.',
    'Não havia necessidade das ordens emitidas',
    'pelas teletelas, chamando-os aos seus postos.',
    'A Oceania estava em guerra com a Lestásia:',
    'a Oceania sempre estivera em guerra com a',
    'Lestásia. Grande parte da literatura política',
    'dos últimos cinco anos tornara-se completamente',
    'obsoleta. Relatórios e reportagens de todo',
    'gênero, jornais, livros, panfletos, filmes,',
    'faixas sonoras, fotografias, tudo precisava',
    'ser retificado com a velocidade do raio.',
    'Embora nenhuma ordem específica, sabia-se',
    'que os chefes do Departamento tencionavam',
    'que, dali a uma semana, não existisse em',
    'parte alguma qualquer referência à guerra',
    'com a Eurásia, ou à aliança com a Lestásia.',
    'O trabalho era estafante, e mais ainda porque',
    'o processo não podia ser chamado pelo seu',
    'nome legítimo. No Departamento de Registro',
    'todos trabalhavam dezoito horas cada vinte',
    'e quatro, com apenas duas sonecas de três',
    'horas. Tinham trazido colchões do porão',
    'e armado pelos corredores: as refeições',
    'consistiam de sanduiches e Café Vitória',
    'levados em carrinhos pelos empregados da',
    'cantina. Cada vez que Winston parava para',
    'ir dormir, procurava deixar a escrivaninha',
    'limpa, mas cada vez que voltava, de olhos',
    'remelentos e doloridos, encontrava mais um',
    'monte de cilindros de papel, que lhe cobriam',
    'a mesa como uma nevada, quase tapando o falascreve',
    'e transbordando para o chão, de modo que',
    'a primeira tarefa era sempre pô-los em',
    'ordem, para ter lugar onde trabalhar., O',
    'pior era que o trabalho não era todo puramente',
    'mecânico. Com freqüência, bastava substituir',
    'apenas um nome por outro, mas qualquer notícia',
    'detalhada exigia cautela e imaginação.',
    'Era considerável, o próprio conhecimento',
    'de geografia necessário para transferir',
    'a guerra de uma a outra parte do mundo. No',
    'terceiro dia, seus olhos doíam insuportàvelmente',
    'e precisava limpar os óculos repetidas',
    'vezes. Era como se lutasse contra uma esmagadora',
    'missão física, algo que podia recusar',
    'e que, no entanto, tinha ânsia neurótica',
    'de realizar. Tanto quanto podia se lembrar,',
    'não o perturbava o fato de ser uma cinica',
    'mentira cada palavra que murmurava no falascreve,',
    'cada rabisco do seu lápis-tinta. Tinha',
    'a ânsia de todos os colegas do Departamento',
    'de realizar uma falsificação perfeita.',
    'Na manhã do sexto dia diminuiu o chorrilho',
    'de papeletas. Durante quase meia-hora, nada',
    'saiu do tubo; depois caiu um cilindro, e',
    'depois nada. Ao mesmo tempo o trabalho amainava',
    'em toda parte. Um profundo suspiro, embora',
    'secreto, levantou-se em toda a repartição.',
    'Encerrara-se uma formidanda proeza, que nunca',
    'poderia ser mencionada. Era agora impossível',
    'a qualquer ser humano provar documentadamente',
    'que houvera uma guerra com a Eurásia. às',
    'doze em ponto, anunciou- se inesperadamente',
    'que todos os funcionários do Ministério',
    'estavam de folga até a manhã seguinte.',
    'Winston, ainda levando a pasta que continha',
    'o livro, e que tivera aos pés enquanto',
    'trabalhava, e sob o corpo enquanto dormia,',
    'foi para casa, barbeou-se e quase adormeceu',
    'no banho, embora a água não estivesse',
    'mais do que tépida. Com uma espécie de',
    'voluptuoso estralar de juntas, subiu a escada',
    'da loja do sr. Charrington. Estava cansado,',
    'mas não tinha mais sono. Abriu a janela,',
    'acendeu o sujo fogareiro de óleo e encheu',
    'dágua uma caçarola, para o café. Júlia',
    'não devia demorar; enquanto não viesse,',
    'leria o livro. Sentou-se na poltrona esfiapada',
    'e abriu a pasta. Um pesado volume negro,',
    'numa encadernação tosca, sem nome nem',
    'título na capa. O tipo também parecia',
    'ligeiramente irregular. As páginas estavam',
    'gastas nas margens, e se destacavam com facilidade,',
    'como se o livro tivesse passado por muitas',
    'mãos. No frontispício havia o título:',
    'TEORIA E PRáTICA DO COLETIVISMO OLIGARQUICO',
    'por Emmanuel Goldstein Winston pôs-se a',
    'ler: Capítulo I Ignorância é Fôrça',
    'Desde que se começou a escrever a história,',
    'e provavelmente desde o fim do Período',
    'Neolítico, tem havido três classes no',
    'mundo, Alta, Média e Baixa. Têm-se subdividido',
    'de muitas maneiras, receberam inúmeros',
    'nomes diferentes, e sua relação quantitativa,',
    'assim como sua atitude em relação às',
    'outras, variaram segundo as épocas; mas',
    'nunca se alterou a estrutura essencial da',
    'sociedade. Mesmo depois de enormes comoções',
    'e transformações aparentemente irrevogáveis,',
    'o mesmo diagrama sempre se restabeleceu,',
    'da mesma forma que um giroscópio em movimento',
    'sempre volta ao equilíbrio, por mais que',
    'seja empurrado deste ou daquele lado. Os',
    'objetivos dêsses três grupos são inteiramente',
    'irreconciliáveis. . . Winston parou de',
    'ler, principalmente com o fito de apreciar',
    'o fato de estar lendo, em confôrto e segurança.',
    'Estava só: nem teletela, nem orelha no',
    'buraco da fechadura, nem impulso nervoso',
    'de espiar por cima do ombro ou de tapar a',
    'página com a mão. O ar doce do verão',
    'soprava-lhe na face. De algum lugar distante',
    'vinham amortecidos gritos de crianças:',
    'no quarto não havia ruido além da voz',
    'de inseto do relógio. Ele afundou mais',
    'ainda na poltrona e pousou os pés na guarda',
    'da lareira. Era a felicidade, a eternidade.',
    'De repente, como às vezes fazemos com um',
    'livro que temos a certeza de ler e reler,',
    'palavra por palavra, abriu-o numa página',
    'diferente e encontrou-se no Capítulo III.',
    'Continuou: Capítulo III Guerra é Paz',
    'A divisão do mundo em três grandes super-estados',
    'foi acontecimento que poderia ter sido, e',
    'deveras foi, previsto antes de meados do',
    'século vinte. Com a absorção da Europa',
    'pela Rússía e do Império Britânico',
    'pelos Estados Unidos passaram a ter existência',
    'efetiva duas das três grandes potências,',
    'a Eurásia e a Oceania. A terceira, a Lestásia,',
    'só surgiu como unidade distinta após',
    'outra década de lutas confusas. As fronteiras',
    'entre os três super-estados são arbitrárias',
    'nalguns pontos, e noutros flutuam segundo',
    'as fortunas da guerra, mas de modo geral',
    'obedecem linhas geográficas. A Eurásia',
    'compreende toda a parte setentrional dos',
    'continentes europeu e asiático, de Portugal',
    'ao estreito de Béring. A Oceania compreende',
    'as Américas, as ilhas do Atlântico, inclusive',
    'as Britânicas, a Australásia e a parte',
    'meridional da áfrica. A Lestásia, menor',
    'que as outras, e de fronteiras ocidentais',
    'menos\'definidas, compreende a China e os',
    'países ao sul da China, as Ilhas do Japão',
    'e uma grande porém cambiante porção',
    'da Mandchúria, da Mongólia e do Tibé.',
    'Numa ou noutra aliança, êsses três',
    'super-estados estão permanentemente em',
    'guerra, e assim tem sido nos últimos vinte',
    'e cinco anos. A guerra, contudo, não é',
    'mais a luta desesperada e aniquiladora que',
    'costumava ser nas primeiras décadas do',
    'século vinte. é uma luta de objetivos',
    'limitados entre combatentes incapazes de',
    'destruir um ao outro, sem causa material',
    'para guerrear e sem mesmo qualquer genuina',
    'divergência ideológica. Isto não significa',
    'que as operações de guerra, ou a atitude',
    'em relação a ela, se tenham tornado mais',
    'cavalheirescas ou menos sanguinárias. Ao',
    'contrário, a histeria guerreira é contínua',
    'e universal em todos os países, e atos',
    'tais como estupros, pilhagens, matança',
    'de crianças e escravização de povoações',
    'inteiras, e represálias contra prisioneiros',
    'que chegam a incluir a morte pela água',
    'fervente e o enterramento de seres vivos,',
    'são considerados normais, e até merítórios,',
    'quando cometidos pelos amigos, e não pelo',
    'inimigo. Materialmente, porém, a guerra',
    'envolve número muito pequeno de cidadãos,',
    'principalmente peritos de alta especialização,',
    'e causa relativamente poucas vítimas. O',
    'combate, quando há combate, trava-se nas',
    'vagas fronteiras cuja localização, o',
    'indivíduo comum só pode imaginar, ou',
    'em tôrno das Fortalezas Flutuantes que',
    'guardam os pontos estratégicos das rotas',
    'marítimas. Nos centros de civilização',
    'a guerra não significa senão escassez',
    'constante de mercadorias de consumo, e a',
    'queda ocasional de uma bombafoguete, que',
    'talvez cause algumas dezenas de mortes. Com',
    'efeito, a guerra mudou de aspecto. Mais exatamente,',
    'mudaram de ordem de importância as razões',
    'pelas quais se faz a guerra. Os motivos já',
    'parcialmente presentes nas grandes guerras',
    'do início do século vinte tornaram-se,',
    'dominantes e são agora reconhecidos conscientemente,',
    'e levados em consideração. Para compreender',
    'a natureza da guerra atual porque, apesar',
    'do reagrupamento que se dá a intervalos,',
    'é sempre a mesma guerra, deve-se perceber,',
    'em primeiro lugar, que não pode ser decisiva.',
    'Nenhum dos três super-estados poderia ser',
    'definitivamente vencido, nem mesmo pelos',
    'dois outros juntos. O equilíbrio é muito',
    'grande, e formidáveis suas defesas naturais.',
    'A Eurásia é protegida por suas vastas',
    'massas de terra, a Oceania pela imensidade',
    'do Atlântico e do Pacífico, a Lestásia',
    'pela fecundidade e a industriosidade dos',
    'seus habitantes. Tampouco existe, sempre',
    'do ponto de vista material, nada, que valha',
    'a pena. Com o estabelecimento de economias',
    'auto- suficientes, nas quais a produção',
    'e o consumo se equilibram, a luta pelos mercados',
    '- causa principal das guerras anteriores',
    '- desapareceu, ao passo que a procura das',
    'matérias primas não é mais caso de',
    'vida ou morte. Cada um dos três super-estados',
    'é tão vasto que possui em seu próprio',
    'território quase todos os materiais de',
    'que necessita. Na medida em que a guerra',
    'tem objetivo econômico direto, é uma',
    'guerra pela mão de obra. Entre as fronteiras',
    'dos super- estados, e não permanentemente',
    'de posse de nenhum, há um tosco quadrilátero',
    'cujos ângulos são Tanger, Brazzaville,',
    'Darwin e Hong Kong, contendo aproximadamente',
    'um quinto da população da terra. é',
    'pela Posse dessas regiões densamente povoadas,',
    'e da calota polar setentrional, que as três',
    'potências vivem em guerra. Na prática,',
    'nenhuma jamais controla toda a área contestada.',
    'Partes dela mudam de mãos constantemente,',
    'e é a casualidade de se apoderar deste',
    'ou daquele fragmento, por um repentino golpe',
    'de traição, que dita a incessante modificação',
    'dos aliados. Todos os territórios disputados',
    'contêm valiosos minerais, e alguns produzem',
    'importantes produtos vegetais, tais como',
    'borracha, que nos clímas mais frios é',
    'necessário sintetizar por métodos relativamente',
    'caros. Acima de tudo, porém, contêm uma',
    'prodigiosa reserva de mão de obra barata.',
    'Quem quer que controle a áfrica equatorial,',
    'ou os países do Oriente Médio, ou a índia',
    'meridional, ou o arquipélago indonésio,',
    'dispõe também de massas de dezenas ou',
    'centenas de milhões de peões diligentes',
    'e mal-pagos. Os habitantes dessas regiões,',
    'reduzidos mais ou menos abertamente à condição',
    'de escravos, passam continuamente de conquistador',
    'a conquistador e são gastos, como o carvão',
    'ou o petróleo, na corrida para produzir',
    'mais armamentos, capturar mais território,',
    'controlar mais braços, para produzir mais',
    'armamentos, para capturar mais território',
    'e assim infinitamente. Cumpre notar que a',
    'luta, na verdade, nunca se alastra além',
    'da periferia das áreas contestadas. As',
    'fronteiras da Eurásia oscilam entre a bacia',
    'do rio Congo e a margem norte do Mediterrâneo;',
    'as ilhas do Oceano índico e do Pacífico',
    'são constantemente capturadas e recapturadas',
    'pela Oceania ou pela Lestásia; na Mongólia',
    'a linha divisória entre Eurásia e Lestásia',
    'não é estável; em tôrno-do Polo as',
    'três potências reclamam enormes territórios',
    'em grande parte desabitados e inexplorados;',
    'mas o equilíbrio de forças mantém-se',
    'sempre na mesma, e permanece inviolado o',
    'território que forma o núcleo de cada',
    'super-estado. Além disso, o trabalho dos',
    'povos explorados que vivem no Equador não',
    'é realmente necessário para a economia',
    'do mundo. Nada acrescentam à riqueza da',
    'terra, desde que só produzem para finalidades',
    'bélicas, sendo o propósito de fazer guerra',
    'estar sempre em melhor posíção para',
    'fazer outra guerra. O trabalho escravo permite',
    'a aceleração do ritmo guerreiro. Se não',
    'existisse, a estrutura da sociedade mundial,',
    'e o processo pelo qual se mantém, não',
    'mudaria essencialmente. O objetivo primário',
    'da guerra moderna (segundo os princípios',
    'do duplipensar, essa meta é simultaneamente',
    'reconhecida e não reconhecida pelos cérebros',
    'orientadores do Partido Interno) é usar',
    'os produtos da máquina sem elevar o padrão',
    'de vida geral. Desde o fim do século dezenove,',
    'foi latente na socíedade industrial o problema',
    'de dar fim ao excesso de artigos de consumo.',
    'Atualmente, que poucos seres humanos têm',
    'bastante para comer, êsse problema evidentemente',
    'não urge, e assim poderia vir a ser, mesmo',
    'sem a intervenção de um processo destruidor',
    'artificial. O mundo de hoje é um planeta',
    'nu, faminto e dilapidado, em comparação',
    'com o que existia antes de 1914, e ainda',
    'mais se comparado com o futuro imaginário',
    'aguardado pelos seus habitantes daquela era.',
    'No comêço do século vinte, a visão',
    'de uma sociedade futura incrivelmente rica,',
    'repousada, ordeira e eficiente, um refulgente',
    'mundo antissético de vidro, aço e concreto',
    'branco de neve, fazia parte da consciência',
    'de quase toda pessoa alfabetizada. A ciência',
    'e a tecnologia se desenvolviam num ritmo',
    'prodigioso, e parecia natural imaginar que',
    'continuassem se desenvolvendo. Isto não',
    'ocorreu, todavia, em parte por causa do empobrecimento',
    'causado por longa série de guerras e revoluções,',
    'em parte porque o progresso científico',
    'e técnico dependia do hábito empírico',
    'do raciocínio, que não podia sobreviver',
    'numa sociedade estritamente regimentada.',
    'No seu conjunto, o mundo é hoje mais primitivo',
    'do que era cinqüenta anos atrás. Certas',
    'zonas atrasadas progrediram, e vários disposítivos,',
    'sempre ligados à guerra -e à espionagem',
    'policial, foram de@senvolvidos, mas já',
    'não há experiência nem invenção,',
    'e nunca foram completamente reparados os',
    'estragos da guerra atômica de 1950 e pouco.',
    'Não obstante, persistem os perigos inerentes',
    'à máquina. Desde o momento em que a máquina',
    'surgiu, tornouse claro a todos que sabiam',
    'raciocinar que desaparecera em grande parte',
    'a necessidade do trabalho braçal do homem',
    'e, portanto, a da desigualdade humana. Se',
    'a máquina fosse deliberadamente utilizada',
    'com êsse propósito, a fome, o excesso',
    'de trabalho, a sujeira, o analfabetismo e',
    'a doença poderiam ter sido eliminados em',
    'algumas gerações. E na verdade, sem ter',
    'sido usada com êsse propósito, porém',
    'por uma espécie de processo automático',
    '- produzindo riqueza que às vezes se tornava',
    'impossível deixar de distribuir, a máquina',
    'elevou grandemente o padrão de vida do',
    'ser humano comum, num período de uns cinqüenta',
    'anos, ao fim do século dezenove e no comêço',
    'do vinte. Tornou-se também claro que o',
    'aumento total da riqueza ameaça a destruição',
    '- com efeito, de certo modo era a destruição',
    '- de uma sociedade hierárquica. Num mundo',
    'em que todos trabalhassem pouco, tivessem',
    'bastante que comer, morassem numa casa com',
    'banheiro e refrigerador, e possuissem automóvel',
    'ou mesmo avião, desapareceria a mais flagrante',
    'e talvez mais importante forma de desigualdade.',
    'Generalizando-se, a riqueza não conferia',
    'distinção. Era possível, sem dúvida,',
    'imaginar uma sociedade em que a riqueza,',
    'no sentido de posse pessoal de bens e luxos,',
    'fosse igualmente distribuida, ficando o poder',
    'nas mãos de uma pequena casta privilegiada.',
    'Mas na prática tal sociedade não poderia',
    'ser estável. Pois se o lazer e a segurança',
    'fossem por todos fruidos, a grande massa',
    'de seres humanos normalmente estupidificada',
    'pela miséria aprenderia a ler e aprenderia',
    'a pensar por si; e uma vez isso acontecesse,',
    'mais cedo ou mais tarde veria que não tinha',
    'função a minoria privilegiada, e acabaria',
    'com ela. De\'maneira permanente, uma sociedade',
    'hierárquica só é possível na báse',
    'da pobreza e da ignorância. Regressar ao',
    'passado agrícola, como imaginaram alguns',
    'pensadores no comêço do século vinte,',
    'não era solução praticável. Entrava',
    'em conflito com a tendência para a mecanização,',
    'que se tornára pouco menos que instintiva',
    'em quase todo o mundo, e além disso, qualquer',
    'país que permanecesse industrialmente atrasado',
    'ficaria indefeso militarmente e estaria fadado',
    'a ser dominado, direta ou indiretamente,',
    'pelos rivais mais progressistas. Tampouco',
    'era solução satisfatória manter as',
    'massas na miséria restringindo a produção',
    'de mercadorias. Isto aconteceu, em grande',
    'parte, durante a fase final do capitalismo,',
    'mais ou menos entre 1920 e 1940. Permitiu-se',
    'que estagnasse a economia de muitos países,',
    'a terra deixou de ser arroteada, o maquinário',
    'básico permaneceu na mesma, grandes setores',
    'da população foram impedidos de trabalhar',
    'e mantidos semivivos por meio de caridade',
    'estatal. Mas isto também provocava debilidade',
    'militar, e como fossem evidentemente desnecessárias',
    'as privações, tornavam inevitável a',
    'oposição. O problema era manter em movimento',
    'as rodas da indústria sem aumentar a riqueza',
    'real do mundo. Era preciso produzir mercadorias,',
    'porém não distribui-las. E, na prática,',
    'a única maneira de o realizar é pela',
    'guerra contínua. O essencial da guerra',
    'é a destruição, não necessàriamente',
    'de vidas humanas, mas dos produtos do trabalho',
    'humano. A guerra é um meio de despedaçar,',
    'ou de libertar na estratosfera, ou de afundar',
    'nas profundezas do mar, materiais que doutra',
    'forma teriam de ser usados para tornar as',
    'massas demasiado confortáveis e portanto,',
    'com o passar do tempo, inteligentes. Mesmo',
    'quando as armas de guerra não são destruidas,',
    'sua manufatura ainda é um modo conveniente',
    'de gastar mão de obra sem produzir nada',
    'que se possa consumir. Uma Fortaleza Flutuante,',
    'por exemplo, contém trabalho suficiente',
    'para construir várias centenas de navios',
    'cargueiros. Depois de algum tempo é demantelada,',
    'por obsoleta, sem ter trazido benefício',
    'material a ninguém, e com novo e enorme',
    'esfôrço, constrói-se outra. Em princípio,',
    'o esfôrço bélico é sempre planejado',
    'de maneira a consumir qualquer excesso que',
    'possa existir depois de satisfeitas as necessidades',
    'mínimas da população. Na prática,',
    'as necessidades da população são sempre',
    'subestimadas, e o resultado é haver uma',
    'escassez crônica de metade dos essenciais',
    'mas isto é considerado vantagem. é uma',
    'política consciente manter perto do sofrimento',
    'até os grupos favorecidos porquanto o estado',
    'geral de escassez aumenta a importância',
    'dos pequenos privilégios e assim amplia',
    'a distinção entre um grupo e outro. Pelos',
    'padrões do início do século vinte,',
    'até mesmo um membro do Partido Interno',
    'leva vida austera e laboriosa. Não obstante,',
    'os poucos luxos de que goza, o apartamento',
    'espaçoso e bem mobiliado, a melhor qualidade',
    'da sua roupa, a superioridade da sua comida,',
    'bebida e fumo, seus dois ou três criados,',
    'seu automóvel ou helicóptero particular,',
    'o colocam numa esfera diferente de um membro',
    'do Partido Externo, que por sua vez tem vantagens',
    'semelhantes em comparação com as massas',
    'submersas a que chamamos "proles". A atmosfera',
    'social é de uma cidade sitiada, onde a',
    'posse de um pedaço de carne de cavalo diferencia',
    'entre a riqueza e a pobreza. E, ao mesmo',
    'tempo, a consciência de estar em guerra',
    'e portanto em perigo, faz parecer natural',
    'a entrega de todo o poder a uma pequena casta:',
    'é uma inevitável condição de sobrevivência.',
    'Veremos que a guerra não apenas realiza',
    'a necessária destruição como a efetua',
    'de maneira psicológicamente aceitável.',
    'Em princípio, seria bastante simples gastar',
    'o excesso de mão de obra construindo templos',
    'e pirâmides, cavando buracos e tornando',
    'a enchê-los, ou mesmo produzindo grandes',
    'quantidades de mercadorias e queimando-as.',
    'Mas isso só daria a base econômica, mas',
    'não a emocional, de uma sociedade hierárquica.',
    'Trata-se aqui não do moral das massas,',
    'cuja atitude não tem importância, contanto',
    'que sejam mantidas no trabalho, mas do moral',
    'do Partido. Espera-se que até mesmo o mais',
    'humilde membro do Partido seja competente,',
    'industrioso e inteligente, dentro de estreitos',
    'limites, Porém é também necessário',
    'que seja um fanático crédulo e ignorante,',
    'cujas reações principais sejam medo,',
    'ódio, adulação e triunfo orgiástico.',
    'Em outras palavras, é necessário que',
    'tenha a mentalidade apropriada ao estado',
    'de guerra. Não importa que de fato haja',
    'uma guerra e, como não é possível uma',
    'vitória decisiva, pouco importa que a guerra',
    'vá bem ou mal. O que importa é que possa',
    'existir o estado de guerra. A divisão intelectual',
    'que o Partido exige dos seus membros, e que',
    'é mais fácil de obter numa atmosfera',
    'de guerra, é agora quase universal, porém,',
    'quanto mais se sobe nos quadros, mais nítida',
    'se torna. é precisamente no Partido Interno',
    'que a histeria de guerra e o ódio ao inimigo',
    'são mais fortes. Na sua posição de',
    'administrador, muitas vezes é necessário',
    'a um membro do Partido Interno saber se esta',
    'ou aquela notícia de guerra é falsa,',
    'e muitas vezes, ele pode perceber que a guerra',
    'inteira é espúria e que, ou não está',
    'sendo travada, ou está sendo travada por',
    'objetivos diferentes dos declarados: mas',
    'essa conciência é fàcilmente neutralizada',
    'pela técnica do duplipensar. Entrementes,',
    'nenhum membro do Partido Interno hesita por',
    'um instante na sua crença mística de',
    'que a guerra é real, que está fadada',
    'a terminar pela vitória, ficando, a Oceania',
    'senhora indisputável do mundo inteiro.',
    'Todos os membros do Partido Interno crêem,',
    'como num artigo de fé, nessa vitória',
    'futura. Será obtida quer pela aquisição',
    'gradual de território e, consequentemente,',
    'acúmulo de esmagadora preponderância',
    'de força, quer pelo descobrimento de uma',
    'nova arma irrespondível. A busca de novas',
    'armas prossegue sem cessar, e é uma das',
    'poucas atividades restantes em que o espírito',
    'inventivo ou especulativo se pode expandir.',
    'Atualmente, na Oceania, a ciência quase',
    'cessou de existir, no sentido antigo. Em',
    'Novilíngua não existe palavra para "ciêncía".',
    'O método empírico de raciocínio, no',
    'qual se basearam todos os desenvolvimentos',
    'científicos passados, se opõe aos princípios',
    'fundamentais do Ingsoc. E mesmo o progresso',
    'tecnológico só se verifica quando os',
    'seus produtos podem ser, de alguma forma,',
    'utilizados para limitar a liberdade humana.',
    'Em todas as artes úteis o mundo ou está',
    'parado ou retrocede. Os campos são cultivados',
    'com arados de tração animal, enquanto',
    'os livros são escritos por máquinas.',
    'Mas nos assuntos de importância vital -',
    'ou seja, a guerra e a espionagem policial',
    '- ainda é incentivado o sistema empírico,',
    'ou pelo menos tolerado. As duas metas do',
    'Partido são conquistar toda a superfície',
    'da terra e extinguir de uma vez para sempre',
    'qualquer possibilidade de pensamento independente.',
    'Há, portanto, dois grandes problemas que',
    'o Partido deve resolver. Um deles é descobrir',
    'o que pensa outro ser humano, e o outro é',
    'matar várias centenas de milhões de pessoas',
    'em alguns segundos, sem dar aviso prévio.',
    'êste é o assunto da pesquisa científica',
    'que ainda subsiste. O cientista de hoje ou',
    'é uma mistura de psicólogo e inquisidor,',
    'estudando com extraordinária minúcia',
    'o significado das expressões faciais, dos',
    'gestos, e tons de voz, e verificando os efeitos',
    'reveladores das drogas-da-verdade, terapia',
    'de choque, hipnose e tortura física; ou',
    'é quimico, físico ou biólogo só interessado',
    'pelos ramos da sua profissão ligados à',
    'supressão da vida. Nos vastos laboratórios',
    'do Ministério da Paz, e nas estações',
    'experimentais ocultas nas florestas brasileiras',
    'ou no deserto australiano, ou nas ilhas perdidas',
    'da Antártida, os grupos de peritos continuam',
    'sua missão, infatigáveis. Alguns se ocupam,',
    'simplesmente, de planejar a logística de',
    'futuras guerras; outros de inventar maiores',
    'e ainda maiores bombas-foguete, explosivos',
    'cada vez mais poderosos, blindagens mais',
    'e mais resistentes; outros buscam novos gases,',
    'mais letais, ou venenos solúveis capazes',
    'de ser produzidos em quantidades tais que',
    'destruam a vegetação de continentes inteiros,',
    'ou culturas de germes maléficos imunizados',
    'contra todos os anticorpos possíveis; outros',
    'se esforçam para produzir um veículo',
    'que abra caminho sob a terra como um submarino',
    'por baixo dágua, ou um aeroplano tão',
    'independente da base como um navio de vela;',
    'outros ainda exploram possibilidades mais',
    'remotas, tais como focalizar os raios do',
    'sol através de lentes suspensas a milhares',
    'de quilômetros da terra, ou provocar terremotos',
    'e maremotos artificiais pela alteração',
    'do calor no centro do planeta. Mas nenhum',
    'dêsses projetos jamais se aproxima da realização,',
    'e nenhum dos três super-estados obtém',
    'dianteira significativa sobre os outros.',
    'O que é mais notável é que as três',
    'potências já possuem, na bomba atômica,',
    'uma arma muito mais poderosa do que as suas',
    'atuais pesquisas lhes permitirão descobrir.',
    'Conquanto o Partido, segundo seu hábito,',
    'reivindique essa invenção, as bombas',
    'atômicas apareceram em mil novecentos e',
    'quarenta e poucos, e foram usadas em larga',
    'escala cerca de dez anos mais tarde. Nessa',
    'ocasião, algumas centenas de bombas foram',
    'lançadas contra os centros industriais,',
    'principalmente da Rússia europeia, Europa',
    'ocidental e América do Norte. O efeito',
    'foi convencer os grupos dominantes de todos',
    'os países que algumas bombas atômicas',
    'mais significariam o fim de toda sociedade',
    'organizada e, portanto, do seu próprio',
    'poder. Daí por diante, embora não se',
    'fizesse, nem se insinuasse qualquer tratado',
    'formal, as bombas-A não foram mais jogadas.',
    'As três potências continuam produzindo',
    'bombas atômicas, e as guardam à espera',
    'da oportunidade decisiva que aguardam para',
    'mais cedo ou mais tarde. Entrementes, a arte',
    'da guerra permaneceu quase estática durante',
    'trinta ou quarenta anos. Usam-se mais helicópteros',
    'do que antigamente, os aviões de bombardeio',
    'foram em grande parte substituidos por projé',
    'teis auto-impelidos, e o frágil encouraçado',
    'móvel deu lugar à quase insubmergível',
    'Fortaleza Flutuante; fora isso, foi pequeno',
    'o desenvolvimento. O tanque, o submarino,',
    'o torpedo, a metralhadora, e até o fusil',
    'e a granada de mão continuam sendo usados.',
    'E apesar dos infindos morticínios comunicados',
    'pela imprensa e as teletelas, nunca se repetiram',
    'as batalhas desesperadas das guerras anteriores,',
    'em que centenas de milhares e até milhões',
    'de homens eram às vezes mortos em algumas',
    'semanas. Nenhum dos três estados tenta',
    'qualquer manobra que envolva o risco d\'uma',
    'séria derrota. Quando empreendem uma operação',
    'de grande envergadura, é em geral um ataque',
    'de surpresa a um aliado. é a mesma a estratégia',
    'seguida pelas três potências, ou pelo',
    'menos as que fingem seguir. O plano prevê,',
    'pela combinação de luta, trocas e oportunos',
    'golpes de traição, a aquisição de',
    'uma série de bases que circundem completamente',
    'um ou outro rival, e então assinar um pacto',
    'de amizade com êsse rival, permanecendo',
    'em paz com ele o tempo suficiente para que',
    'as suspeitas esmoreçam. Durante êsses',
    'anos de espera, foguetes carregados de bombas',
    'atômicas podem ser acumulados em todos',
    'os pontos estratégicos; serão por fim',
    'disparados simultaneamente, com efeitos tão',
    'devastadores que é impossível retaliar.',
    'Surge então o momento de assinar um tratado',
    'de amizade com a terceira potência mundial,',
    'preparando outro ataque. êste plano, evidentemente,',
    'é puro castelo no ar, impossível de realizar.',
    'Além disso, não há combate algum, exceto',
    'nas zonas contestadas, em tôrno do Equador',
    'e do Polo Norte; jamais se empreende qualquer',
    'invasão de território inimigo. Isto explica',
    'o fato de serem arbitrárias em muitos pontos',
    'as fronteiras entre os super- estados. A',
    'Eurásia, por exemplo, poderia fàcilmente',
    'conquistar as Ilhas Britânicas, que geogràficamente',
    'fazem parte da Europa, e por outro lado seria',
    'possível a Oceania levar suas fronteiras',
    'até o Reno ou o Vístula. Mas isto violaria',
    'o princípio de integração cultural,',
    'respeitado por todos os lados, embora jamais',
    'formulado. Se a Oceania conquistasse as regiões',
    'outrora conhecidas por França e Alemanha,',
    'seria necessário, ou exterminar os habitantes,',
    'tarefa de enorme dificuldade física, ou',
    'assimilar uma população de uns cem milhões',
    'de pessoas que, no que se refere ao desenvolvimento',
    'técnico, estão mais ou menos no nível',
    'da Oceania. O problema é o mesmo para os',
    'três super-estados. é absolutamente necessária,',
    'para sua estrutura, que não haja contacto',
    'com estrangeiros, exceto, limitadamente,',
    'com prisioneiros de guerra e escravos de',
    'cor. Mesmo o aliado oficial de hoje é considerado',
    'com suspeita. Além dos prisioneiros de',
    'guerra, o cidadão médio da Oceania jamais',
    'põe olhos num cidadão da Eurásia ou',
    'da Lestásia, sendo-lhe proibido aprender',
    'línguas estrangeiras. Se lhe fosse permitido',
    'o contacto com os forasteiros, descobriria',
    'que são criaturas semelhantes e que é',
    'mentira a maior parte do que ouviu a respeito',
    'deles. Acabar-se-ia o mundo fechado em que',
    'vive, e se evaporariam o medo, o ódio,',
    'e o sentido de razão permanente, de que',
    'depende o seu moral. é portanto admitido',
    'por todos os lados que, não obstante a',
    'freqüência com que a Pérsia, o Egito,',
    'Java ou Ceilão mudam de mãos, as fronteiras',
    'básicas não devem nunca ser atravessadas,',
    'salvo pelas bombas. Atrás disto tudo há',
    'um fato que se não menciona jamais em voz',
    'alta, mas que é tàcitamente compreendido',
    'e usado como orientação: ou seja, o de',
    'que as condições de vida, nos três',
    'super-estados, são mais ou menos as mesmas.',
    'Na Oceania, a filosofia dominante é chamada',
    'Ingsoc, na Eurásia é chamada Neo-Bolchevismo,',
    'e na Lestásia é conhecida por uma palavra',
    'chinesa em geral traduzida por Adoração',
    'da Morte, mas que se poderia melhor chamar',
    'Obliteração do Ego. O cidadão da Oceania',
    'não pode saber coisa alguma a respeito',
    'dos fundamentos das outras duas filosofias,',
    'aprendendo porém a execrá-las como bárbaros',
    'ultrages à moralidade e ao sentido comum.',
    'Na verdade, as três filosofias mal se distinguem',
    'umas das outras, e os sistemas sociais de',
    'que são base não se distinguem de modo',
    'algum. Por toda parte há a mesma estrutura',
    'piramidal, a mesma adoração de um chefe',
    'semi-divino, a mesma economia que existe',
    'para a guerra contínua. Segue-se que os',
    'três super-estados não só não podem',
    'vencer um ao outro, como não levariam vantagem',
    'se o fizessem. Ao contrário, enquanto continuarem',
    'em conflitos, amparam-se uns aos outros,',
    'como três fusis num sarilho. E, como é',
    'praxe, os grupos dominantes das três potências',
    'ao mesmo tempo sabem e ignoram o que estão',
    'fazendo. Dedicam a vida à conquista do',
    'mundo, mas também sabem que é necessário',
    'continuar a guerra, sem fim e sem vitória.',
    'Entrementes, o fato de não haver perigo',
    'de conquista torna possível a negação',
    'da realidade que \'é a característica',
    'principal do Ingsoc, e dos sistemas rivais',
    'de raciocínio. Neste ponto é necessário',
    'repetir o que já dissemos: que a guerra,',
    'tornando-se contínua, mudou fundamentalmente',
    'de caráter. No passado a guerra era, quase',
    'por definição, algo que mais cedo ou',
    'mais tarde chegava ao fim, em geral em inconfundível',
    'vitória ou derrota. Também no passado,',
    'a guerra era um dos instrumentos pelo qual',
    'as sociedades humanas se mantinham em contacto',
    'com a realidade física. Todos os governantes',
    'de todas as épocas têm tentado impôr',
    'aos seus adeptos uma falsa visão do mundo,',
    'mas não podiam se dar ao luxo de encorajar',
    'nenhuma ilusão que tendesse a prejudicar',
    'a eficiência militar. Considerando que',
    'a derrota signíficava a perda de independência,',
    'ou outro resultado geralmente julgado indesejável,',
    'era preciso tomar sérias precauções',
    'contra a derrota. Não se podia ignorar',
    'os fatos físicos. Na filosofia, religião,',
    'ética, ou política, dois e dois podem',
    'ser cinco, mas quando se desenha um canhão',
    'ou um\' aeroplano, somam quatro. As nações',
    'ineficientes eram vencidas, mais cedo ou',
    'mais tarde, e a luta pela eficiência era',
    'inimiga das ilusões. Além do mais, para',
    'ser eficiente, era necessário saber aprender',
    'do passado, o que exigia conhecimento bastante',
    'exato do que sucedera nesse passado. Naturalmente,',
    'os jornais e livros sempre foram parciais,',
    'e coloridos por diversos pontos de vista,',
    'mas seria impossível a falsificação',
    'da espécie e na escala hoje praticada.',
    'A guerra era uma firme salvaguarda de saúde',
    'mental e, no que se referia às classes',
    'dominantes, provavelmente a mais importante',
    'de todas as salvaguardas. Enquanto era possível',
    'perder ou ganhar guerras, nenhuma classe',
    'dominante podia ser completamente irresponsável.',
    'Mas quando a guerra se torna literalmente',
    'contínua, cessa também de ser perigosa.',
    'Quando a guerra é contínua, não existe',
    'necessidade militar. O progresso técnico',
    'pode cessar e os fatos mais palpáveis podem',
    'ser negados ou desprezados. Como vimos, as',
    'pesquisas que poderiam ser chamadas científicas',
    'são ainda levadas a cabo, com finalidades',
    'bélicas, mas são, em essência, um sonho',
    'vão, e não importa que não dêem o',
    'menor resultado. A eficiência não mais',
    'é necessária, nem mesmo a eficiência',
    'militar. Nada é eficiente na\'Oceania, exceto',
    'a Polícia do Pensamento. Já que cada',
    'um dos super-estados é invencível, cada',
    'qual é, com efeito, um universo separado',
    'dentro do qual se pode praticar sem risco',
    'qualquer perversão mental. A realidade',
    'só exerce a sua pressão através das',
    'necessidades da vida cotidiana, comer e',
    'beber, morar e vestir, evitar engulir veneno,',
    'cair de janelas do último andar, e coisas',
    'semelhantes. Entre a vida e a morte, e entre',
    'o prazer físico e a dor física, ainda',
    'há uma distinção, mas é só. Sem',
    'contacto com o mundo externo e com o passado,',
    'o cidadão da Oceania é como um homem',
    'no espaço interestelar, que não tem meios',
    'de saber que direção leva para baixo',
    'ou para cima. Os governantes dêsse estado',
    'são absolutos como os faraós e os césares',
    'não puderam ser. São obrigados a evitar',
    'que os seus correligionários morram de',
    'fome em quantidades tais que se tornem inconvenientes,',
    'e são forçados a permanecer no mesmo',
    'baixo nível de técnica militar que os',
    'seus rivais; uma vez atingido esse mínimo,',
    'porém, podem torcer a realidade e dar-lhe',
    'a forma que lhes aprouver. A julgar pelos',
    'padrões das guerras passadas, a guerra',
    'de hoje é, portanto, uma impostura. é',
    'como os combates entre certos ruminantes,',
    'cujos chifres são dispostos em ângulo',
    'tal que não pódem ferir um ao outro.',
    'Entretanto, apesar de irreal, ela tem sentido.',
    'Devora os excedentes dos artigos de consumo,',
    'e ajuda a conservar a atmosfera mental especial',
    'que uma sociedade hierárquica exige. A',
    'guerra, como veremos, é agora assunto puramente',
    'interno. No passado, os grupos dominantes',
    'de todos os países, não obstante pudessem',
    'reconhecer seu interêsse comum e, em consequência,',
    'limitassem o poder destruidor da guerra,',
    'de fato combatiam, e o vencedor sempre saqueava',
    'o vencido. Em nossos dias, eles não combatem',
    'uns aos outros. A guerra é travada, pelos',
    'grupos dominantes, contra os seus próprios',
    'súditos, e o Seu objetivo não é conquistar',
    'territórios, nem impedir que os outros',
    'o façam, porém manter intacta a estrutura',
    'da sociedade. Daí, o se haver tornado equívoca',
    'a própria palavra "guerra." Seria provavelmente',
    'correto dizer que a guerra deixou de existir',
    'ao se tornar contínua. A pressão que',
    'exerceu sobre os seres humanos entre a Idade',
    'Neolítica e o comêço do século XX',
    'desapareceu e foi substituida por algo bem',
    'diferente. O efeito seria mais ou menos o',
    'mesmo se os três super-estados, ao invés',
    'de se guerrearem, concordassem em viver em',
    'paz perpétua, cada qual inviolado dentro',
    'das suas fronteiras. Pois nesse caso ainda',
    'seria um universo contido em si próprio,',
    'para sempre livre da influência moderadora',
    'do perigo externo. Uma paz verdadeiramente',
    'permanente seria o mesmo que a guerra permanente.',
    'êste, embora a vasta maioria dos membros',
    'do Partido só o compreendam num sentido',
    'mais raso, é o significado profundo do',
    'lema do Partido: Guerra é Paz. Winston',
    'parou de ler por um momento. Na distância',
    'remota uma bomba-foguete estourou. Ainda',
    'não sumira a deliciosa sensação de',
    'se sentir só com o livro proibido, num',
    'quarto sem teletela. A solidão e a segurança',
    'eram sensações físicas, de certo modo',
    'misturadas com o cansaço do seu corpo,',
    'a maciez da cadeira, a brisa gentil que tocava',
    'o rosto, soprando pela janela. O livro fascinava-o',
    'ou, mais exatamente, dava-lhe nova tranquilidade.',
    'De certo modo, nada lhe dizia de novo, mas',
    'isso fazia parte do seu atrativo. Dizia o',
    'que ele diria, se lhe fosse possível pôr',
    'ordem nos seus pensamentos desataviados.',
    'Era produto de um cérebro semelhante ao',
    'seu, porém -enormemente mais poderoso,',
    'mais sistemático, menos medroso. Ele percebia',
    'que os melhores livros são os que dizem',
    'o que já se sabe. Voltara ao Capítulo',
    '1 quando ouviu o passo de Júlia na escada',
    'e levantou-se para lhe sair ao encontro.',
    'Ela largou a bolsa de ferramentas no chão',
    'e atirou-se aos braços dele. Fazia mais',
    'de uma semana que não se viam., Recebi',
    'o livro, anunciou ele, quando se soltaram.',
    '- Recebeste? Que bom!, exclamou ela, sem',
    'maior interêsse, e imediatamente se ajoelhou',
    'ao pé do fogareiro de óleo para fazer',
    'café. Não voltaram ao assunto senão',
    'depois de terem estado meia hora na cama.',
    'A noite refrescara um pouco, levando-os a',
    'puxar a colcha. Lá de baixo vinham os ruidos',
    'familiares de botinas arrastando no lageado,',
    'e cantoria. A mulheraça de braços vermelhos,',
    'que Winston Vira na sua primeira visita,',
    'parecia fazer parte do pátio. Parecia não',
    'haver hora do dia em que não estivesse',
    'marchando entre o tanque e o varal, ora tapando',
    'a boca com prendedores de roupa, ora abrindo',
    'os pulmões com gôsto. Júlia deitara-se',
    'de lado e parecia estar a ponto de adormecer.',
    'Ele apanhou o livro, que depusera no soalho,',
    'e acomodou-se, encostando na cabeceira da',
    'cama., Deves lê-lo, disse ele., Tu também.',
    'Todos os membros da Fraternidade devem lê-lo.',
    '- Tu lês, disse ela com os olhos fechados.',
    '- Lê alto. é o melhor. E assim vais explicando',
    'ao mesmo tempo. os ponteiros do relógio',
    'marcavam seis, indicando as dezoito. Ainda',
    'tinham três ou quatro horas pela frente.',
    'Ele apoiou o livro nos joelhos e pôs-se',
    'a ler: Capítulo I Ignorância é Fôrça',
    'Desde que se começou a escrever a história,',
    'e provavelmente desde o fim do Período',
    'Neolítico, tem havido três classes no',
    'mundo, Alta, Média e Baixa. Têm-se subdividido',
    'de muitas maneiras, receberam inúmeros',
    'nomes diferentes, e sua relação quantitativa,',
    'assim como sua atitude em relação às',
    'outras, variaram segundo as épocas; mas',
    'nunca se alterou a estrutura essencial da',
    'sociedade. Mesmo depois de enormes comoções',
    'e transformações aparentemente irrevogáveis,',
    'o mesmo diagrama sempre se restabeleceu,',
    'da mesma forma que um giroscópio em movimento',
    'sempre volta ao equilíbrio, por mais que',
    'seja empurrado deste ou daquele lado., Júlia,',
    'estás acordada?, indagou Winston., Estou,',
    'meu amor. Estou escutando. Vai lendo. é',
    'maravilhoso. Ele continuou a ler: Os objetivos',
    'dêsses três grupos são inteiramente',
    'irreconciliáveis. O objetivo da Alta é',
    'ficar onde está. O da Média é trocar',
    'de lugar com a Alta. E o objetivo da Baixa,',
    'quando tem objetivo, pois é característica',
    'constante da Baixa viver tão esmagada pela',
    'monotonia do trabalho cotidiano que só',
    'intermitentemente tem consciência do que',
    'existe fora de sua vida, é abolir todas',
    'as distinções e criar uma sociedade em',
    'que todos sejam iguais. Assim, por toda a',
    'história, trava-se repetidamente uma luta',
    'que é a mesma em seus traços gerais.',
    'Por longos períodos a Alta parece firme',
    'no poder, porém mais cedo ou mais tarde',
    'chega um momento em que, ou perde a fé',
    'em si própria ou sua capacidade de governar',
    'com eficiência, ou ambas. é então derrubada',
    'pela Média, que atrai a Baixa ao seu lado,',
    'fingindo lutar pela liberdade e a justiça.',
    'Assim que alcança sua meta, a Média joga',
    'a Baixa na sua velha posição servil e',
    'transforma-se em Alta. Dentro em breve, uma',
    'nova classe Média se separa dos outros',
    'grupos, de um deles ou de ambos, e a luta',
    'recomeça. Das três classes, só a Baixa',
    'nunca consegue nem êxito temporário na',
    'obtenção dos seus ideais. Seria exagêro',
    'dizer que não se registra na história',
    'progresso material. Mesmo hoje, neste período',
    'de declínio, o ser humano comum é fisicamente',
    'melhor do que há alguns séculos. Mas',
    'nenhum progresso em riqueza, nenhuma suavização',
    'de maneiras, nenhuma reforma ou revolução',
    'jamais aproximou um milímetro a igualdade',
    'humana. Do ponto de vista da Baixa, nenhuma',
    'modificação hístórica significou',
    'mais do que uma mudança do nome dos amos.',
    'Por volta dos fins do século dezenove,',
    'a recorrência do ciclo se tornára óbvia-',
    'a muitos observadores. Surgiram então escolas',
    'filosóficas que interpretavam a história',
    'como um processo cíclico e protestavam',
    'que a desigualdade era a lei inalterável',
    'da vida humana. Essa doutrina, naturalmente,',
    'sempre teve seus adeptos, mas na maneira',
    'pela qual foi então exposta havia uma transformação',
    'significativa. No passado, fora uma doutrina',
    'especificamente da Alta a necessidade de',
    'uma forma hierárquica de sociedade. Fôra',
    'pregada por reis, aristocratas e sacerdotes,',
    'advogados, etc., que a parasitavam, e fora',
    'geralmente amaciada por promessas de recompensa',
    'num mundo imaginário de além-túmulo.',
    'A Média, enquanto lutou pelo poder, sempre',
    'fez uso de termos tais como liberdade, justiça',
    'e fraternidade. Agora, todavia, o conceito',
    'de fraternidade humana começou a ser atacado',
    'pelos que não se encontravam em posição',
    'de mando, porém esperavam conquistá-',
    'las dentro em breve. No passado a Média',
    'fizera revoluções sob a bandeira da igualdade,',
    'estabelecendo nova tirania assim que derrubava',
    'a antiga. Com efeito, os novos grupos Médios',
    'proclamavam antecipadamente sua tirania.',
    'O socialismo, teoria aparecida no ínício',
    'do século dezenove é o último élo',
    'duma cadeia de pensamento que se iniciava',
    'nas rebeliões dos escravos antigos, ainda',
    'estava profundamente infeccionado pelo Utopismo',
    'do passado. Mas em cada variante de Socialismo',
    'que apareceu de 1900 para cá, o propósito',
    'de estabelecer a liberdade e a igualdade',
    'ia sendo abandonado cada vez mais abertamente.',
    'Os novos movimentos, que apareceram em meados',
    'do século, o Ingsoc na Oceania, o Neo-bolchevismo',
    'na Eurásia, a Adoração da Morte, como',
    'é comumente chamado, na Lestásia, tinham',
    'o propósito consciente de perpetuar a desliberdade',
    'e a desigualdade. êsses novos movimentos,',
    'naturalmente, surgiram dos mais antigos e',
    'tenderam a conservar o nome e a render tributo',
    'à sua ideologia. Mas o propósito de todos',
    'era deter o progresso e congelar a história',
    'num dado momento. O movimento familiar do',
    'pêndulo deveria ter lugar mais uma vez,',
    'e então parar. Como de hábito, a Alta',
    'devia ser posta abaixo pela Média, que',
    'então se tornaria a Alta; desta vez porém',
    'a Alta, por meio de uma estratégia consciente,',
    'conseguiria manter permanentemente sua posição.',
    'As novas doutrinas nasceram em parte por',
    'causa do acúmulo de conhecimento histórico,',
    'e o crescimento do sentido histórico, que',
    'mal existira antes do século dezenove.',
    'O movimento cíclico da história era agora',
    'inteligível ou parecia ser; e, sendo inteligível,',
    'era alterável. Mas a causa principal, subexistente,',
    'era que, desde o comêço do século vinte,',
    'a igualdade humana se tornara tècnicamente',
    'possível. Verdade ainda que os homens não',
    'eram iguais nos seus talentos inatos e que',
    'as funções tinham de ser especializadas',
    'de maneira que favoreciam uns indivíduos',
    'contra outros; porém não havia mais nenhuma',
    'necessidade real de distinção de classe',
    'nem de grandes diferenças de fortuna. Em',
    'épocas anteriores, as distinções não',
    'tinham sido apenas inevitáveis como desejáveis.',
    'A desigualdade era o preço da civilização.',
    'Todavia, com o desenvolvimento da produção',
    'à máquina, alterou-se o caso. Mesmo que',
    'ainda fosse necessário aos seres humanos',
    'desempenhar diferentes tipos de profissão,',
    'já não era preciso que vivessem em díferentes',
    'níveis sociais ou econômicos. Portanto,',
    'do ponto de vista dos novos grupos que estavam',
    'a pique de tomar o poder, a igualdade humana',
    'não era mais um ideal a atingir, era um',
    'perigo a evitar. Em épocas mais primitivas,',
    'quando de fato não era possível uma sociedade',
    'justa e pacífica, fora bem fácil acreditar',
    'nela. A idéia de um paraíso terreno em',
    'que os homens vivessem juntos num estado',
    'de fraternidade, sem leis nem trabalho brutal,',
    'incendiara durante milhares de anos a imaginação',
    'humana. E essa visão tinha certo fascínio',
    'mesmo sobre os grupos que realmente se beneficiaram',
    'de cada mudança histórica. Os herdeiros',
    'das revoluções inglêsas, francesa e',
    'americana haviam parcialmente acreditado',
    'nas suas próprias frases a respeito dos',
    'direitos do homem, liberdade de palavra,',
    'igualdade perante a lei, e quejandas, e até',
    'haviam permitido que sua conduta fosse por',
    'elas influenciadas, dentro de certos limites.',
    'Mas ao advir a quarta década do século',
    'vinte, eram autoritárias todas as principais',
    'correntes de pensamento político. O paraíso',
    'terreno se desacreditara no momento exato',
    'em que se tornára realizável. Cada nova',
    'teoria política, fosse qual fosse o seu',
    'rótulo, conduzia de novo à hierarquia',
    'e à regimentação. E no endurecimento',
    'geral de atitudes verificado por volta de',
    '1930, práticas havia longo tempo abandonadas,',
    'em alguns casos durante séculos, prisão',
    'sem julgamento, uso de prisioneiros de guerra',
    'como escravos, execuções públicas,',
    'tortura para arrancar confissões, o uso',
    'de reféns e deportação de populações',
    'inteiras, não só voltaram a ser comuns',
    'como eram toleradas e até defendidas por',
    'pessoas que se consideravam esclarecidas',
    'e progressistas. Só depois de uma década',
    'de guerras nacionais, guerras civis, revoluções',
    'e contra-revoluções em toda parte do',
    'mundo é, que o Ingsoc e seus rivais emergiram',
    'como teorias políticas completas. Haviam',
    'porém sido antecipados por vários sistemas,',
    'geralmente chamados totalitários, aparecidos',
    'no mesmo século, sendo evidentes, havia',
    'muito tempo, as linhas principais do mundo',
    'que nasceria do caos existente. Fôra também',
    'bastante evidente que tipo de pessoas controlaria',
    'êste mundo. A nova aristocracia era composta,',
    'na sua maioria, de burocratas, cientistas,',
    'técnicos, organizadores sindicais, peritos',
    'em publicidade, sociólogos, professores,',
    'jornalistas e políticos profissionais.',
    'Esta gente, cuja origem estava na classe',
    'média assalariada e nos escalões superiores',
    'da classe operária, fora moldada e criada',
    'pelo mundo estéril da indústria monopolista',
    'e do govêrno centralizado. Comparada com',
    'os seus antecessores, era menos avarenta,',
    'menos tentada pelo luxo, mais faminta de',
    'poder puro e, acima de tudo, mais consciente',
    'do que fazia e mais decidida a esmagar a',
    'oposição. Esta última diferença era',
    'cardeal. Comparadas com as que existem hoje,',
    'todas as tiranias do passado foram frouxas',
    'e ineficientes. Os grupos governantes foram',
    'sempre infestados, até certo ponto, de',
    'idéias liberais, e se contentavam de deixar',
    'pontas soltas por toda parte, considerando',
    'apenas o ato patente e se desinteressando',
    'pelo raciocínio dos seus súditos. Até',
    'a igreja católica da Idade Média era',
    'tolerante, pelos padrões atuais. Em parte',
    'a razão deste fato residia na impossibilidade',
    'dos governos do passado manterem sob constante',
    'vigilância os seus cidadãos. A invenção',
    'da imprensa, contudo, tornou mais fácil',
    'manipular a opinião pública, processo',
    'que o filme e o rádio levaram além. Com',
    'o desenvolvimento da televisão, e o progresso',
    'técnico que tornou possível receber e',
    'transmitir simultaneamente pelo mesmo instrumento,',
    'a vida particular acabou. Cada cidadão,',
    'ou pelo menos cada cidadão suficientemente',
    'importante para merecer espionagem, passou',
    'a poder ser mantido vinte e quatro horas',
    'por dia sob os olhos da polícia e ao alcance',
    'da propaganda oficial, fechados todos os',
    'outros canais de comunicação. Existia',
    'pela primeira vez a possibilidade de fazer',
    'impôr não apenas completa obediência',
    'à vontade do Estado como também completa',
    'uniformidade de opinião em todos os súditos.',
    'Depois do período revolucionário de 1950',
    'a 1970, a sociedade reagrupou-se, como sempre,',
    'em Alta, Média e Baixa. Mas a nova Alta,',
    'ao contrário das antecessoras, não agia',
    'por instinto: sabia o que era preciso para',
    'garantir sua posição. Havia muito tempo',
    'se percebera que a única base segura da',
    'oligarquia é o coletivismo. A riqueza e',
    'o privilégio são mais fáceis de defender',
    'quando possuidos em conjunto. A chamada "abolição',
    'da propriedade privada", que se verificou',
    'em meados do século, significou, com efeito',
    'a concentração da propriedade em número',
    'muito menor de mãos, mas com a diferença',
    'de que os novos donos eram um grupo em vez',
    'de uma massa de indivíduos. Individualmente,',
    'nenhum membro do Partido possui coisa alguma,',
    'exceto ninharias pessoais. Coletivamente,',
    'o Partido é dono de tudo na Oceania, porque',
    'tudo controla, e dispõe dos seus produtos',
    'como bem lhe parece. Nos anos que se seguiram',
    'à Revolução, conseguiu galgar quase',
    'sem oposição êsse posto de comando,',
    'porque todo o processo foi apresentado como',
    'ato de coletivização. Sempre se imaginara',
    'que se a classe capitalista fosse expropriada,',
    'o Socialismo adviria: e inquestionàvelmente',
    'os capitalistas tinham sido expropriados.',
    'Fábricas, minas, terras, casas, transporte',
    '- tudo lhes fora tomado: e dado que -não',
    'mais eram propriedade particular, evidentemente',
    'deviam ser propriedade pública. O Ingsoc,',
    'que brotou do movimento socialista anterior',
    'e dele herdou a fraseologia, com efeito executara',
    'o principal do programa socialista. E o resultado,',
    'previsto e pretendido antecipadamente, fora',
    'tornar permanente a desigualdade econômica.',
    'Mas vão mais fundo os problemas de perpetúá\'r',
    'a soci\'edade hierárquica. Só há quatro',
    'modos de um grupo governante abandonar o',
    'poder. Ou é vencido de fora, ou governa',
    'tão ineficientemente que as massas são',
    'levadas à revolta, ou permite o aparecimento',
    'de um grupo médio forte e descontente,',
    'ou perde a confiança em si e a disposição',
    'de governar. Essas causas não funcionam',
    'de per si, e via de regra as quatro se apresentam',
    'em diferentes proporções. Uma classe',
    'dominante que possa se guardar contra as',
    'quatro permaneceria eternamente no poder.',
    'No fim de contas, o fator determinante é',
    'a atitude mental da própria classe dominante.',
    'Depois de meados deste século, desapareceu',
    'o primeiro perigo. As três potências',
    'em que o mundo se dividiu são de fato invencíveis,',
    'e só poderiam se tornar vulneráveis por',
    'meio de lentas mutações demográficas',
    'que um govêrno com amplos poderes consegue',
    'evitar fàcilmente. O segundo perigo, também',
    'é apenas teórico. As massas nunca se',
    'revoltarão espontâneamente, e nunca se',
    'revoltarão apenas por ser oprimidas. Com',
    'efeito, se não se lhes permite ter padrões',
    'de comparação -nem ao menos se darão',
    'conta de que são oprimidas. As crises econômicas',
    'decorrentes do passado eram totalmente desnecessárias',
    'e hoje já não podem se verificar, mas',
    'podem suceder outros deslocamentos igualmente',
    'grandes, sem que haja resultados políticos,',
    'por não existir maneira de articular o',
    'descontentamento e dar-lhe vasão. No que',
    'tange ao problema da superprodução, latente',
    'em nossa sociedade desde o desenvolvimento',
    'da técnica da máquina, é resolvido',
    'por meio do método da guerra cõntínua',
    '(vide Capítulo 3), também útil para',
    'manter o moral público no diapasão desejado.',
    'Do ponto de vista dos nossos atuais governantes,',
    'portanto, os únicos perigos genuinos são',
    'a formação de um novo grupo de gente',
    'capaz, sem muito trabalho, e faminta de poder,',
    'e o crescimento do liberalismo e do ceticismo',
    'nas suas fileiras governamentais. Isto é,',
    'o problema é educacional. é um problema',
    'de moldar continuamente a consciência tanto',
    'do grupo dirigente como do grupo executivo,',
    'mais amplo, que fica logo abaixo dele. -',
    'A consciência das massas precisa ser influenciada',
    'apenas de modo negativo. Dados estes esclarecimentos,',
    'poder-se-ia inferir, se já não se conhecesse,',
    'a estrutura geral da sociedade oceânica.',
    'No alto da pirâmide está o Grande Irmão.',
    'O Grande Irmão é onipotente. Cada sucesso,',
    'realização, vitória, descobrimento',
    'científico, toda sabedoria, sapiência,',
    'virtude, felicidade, são atribuídos diretamente',
    'à sua liderança e inspiração. Ninguém',
    'nunca viu o Grande Irmão. é uma cara',
    'nos tapumes, uma voz das teletelas. Podemos',
    'ter râzoável certeza de que nunca morrerá,',
    'e já existe considerável incerteza da',
    'data em que nasceu. O Grande Irmão é',
    'a forma em que o Partido resolveu se apresentar',
    'ao mundo. Sua função é a de ponte focal',
    'para o amor, medo, reverência, emoções',
    'que podem mais fàcilmente ser sentidas',
    'em relação a um indivíduo do que a',
    'uma organização. Abaixo do Grande Irmão',
    'vem o Partido Interno, com seus seis milhões',
    'de membros, ou seja, menos de dois por cento',
    'da população da Oceania. Abaixo do Partido',
    'Interno vem o Externo, que pode ser chamado',
    'de mãos do Estado, se ao primeiro se atribuir',
    'o papel de cérebro. Abaixo dele vem a massa',
    'muda a que nos referimos habitualmente por',
    '"proles" e que talvez constitua oitenta e',
    'cinco por cento da população. Nos termos',
    'da nossa classificação anterior, os proles',
    'são a Baixa, pois a população escrava',
    'das terras equatoriais, que constantemente',
    'trocam de mãos, não é parte permanente',
    'nem necessária da estrutura. Em princípio,',
    'não é hereditária a participação',
    'em qualquer dos três grupos. Filho de pais',
    'do Partido Interno não é, em teoria,',
    'a ele filiado. A admissão a qualquer das',
    'esferas do Partido se faz por exame, prestado',
    'aos dezesseis anos. Não há nenhuma discriminação',
    'racial, nem qualquer pronunciado domínio',
    'de uma província sobre outra. Encontram-se',
    'judeus, negros, sul-americanos de puro sangue',
    'índio nos postos mais elevados do Partido,',
    'e os administradores regionais\' são sempre',
    'convocados dentre os naturais da área.',
    'Em nenhuma parte da Oceania têm os habitantes',
    'a impressão de ser colonia administrada',
    'de uma longínqua capital. A Oceania não',
    'tem capital, e o seu chefe titular é uma',
    'pessoa cujo paradeiro todos ignoram. Não',
    'é centralizada de modo algum, à exceção',
    'da língua franca, que é o inglês, e',
    'da Novilíngua, que é o idioma oficial.',
    'Seus governantes não são ligados por',
    'laços de consangüinidade mas pela obediência',
    'a uma doutrina comum. é verdade que a nossa',
    'sociedade é estratificada, e muito rigidamente,',
    'segundo o que, à primeira vista, parecem',
    'ser linhas hereditárias. Há muitíssimo',
    'menos movimento de vai e vem entre os grupos',
    'diferentes do que acontecia no capitalismo',
    'ou mesmo nos períodos pré-industriais.',
    'Entre os dois ramos do Partido existe certa',
    'dose de intercâmbio, cujo único propósito,',
    'porém, é permitir a exclusão dos fracos',
    'do Partido Interno e a neutralização',
    'dos mais ambiciosos militantes do Partido',
    'Externo, guindados a uma esfera mais elevada.',
    'Na prática, os proletários não têm',
    'direito de entrar para o Partido. Os mais',
    'bem dotados, que poderiam se tornar núcleos',
    'de descontentamento, são simplesmente assinalados',
    'pela Polícia do Pensamento e eliminados.',
    'Mas êsse estado de coisas não é necessàriamente',
    'permanente, nem é questão de princípio.',
    'O Partido não é uma classe no antigo',
    'sentido da palavra. Não tem por objetivo',
    'transmitir o poder aos próprios filhos;',
    'e se não houvesse outro meio de conservar',
    'os mais capazes nos postos de comando, estaria',
    'perfeitamente disposto a recrutar toda uma',
    'geração nova das fileiras do proletariado.',
    'Nos anos cruciais, muito contribuiu para',
    'neutralizar a oposição o fato de o Partido',
    'não ser um organismo hereditário. O antigo',
    'tipo de socialista, treinado a lutar contra',
    'o que às vezes se chamava "privilégio',
    'de classe," supunha que o que não fosse',
    'hereditário não podia ser permanente.',
    'Não percebia que a continuidade de uma',
    'oligarquia não precisava ser física,',
    'nem fazia pausa para refletir que as aristocracias',
    'hereditárias sempre tiveram vida curta,',
    'enquanto que organizações auto- renovantes,',
    'como a Igreja Católica, às vezes duram',
    'centenas e mesmo milhares de anos. A essência',
    'do jugo oligárquico não é a herança',
    'de pai a filho, mas a persistência de certo',
    'ponto de vista em face do mundo e de certa',
    'maneira de viver, imposta aos vivos pelos',
    'mortos. Um grupo dominante só continua',
    'mandando enquanto consegue nomear seus sucessores.',
    'O Partido não se interessa pela perpetuação',
    'do seu sangue, mas pela perpetuação da',
    'entidade. O que importa não é quem maneja',
    'o poder, contanto que permaneça sempre',
    'a mesma a estrutura hierárquica. Tôdas',
    'as crenças, hábitos, gostos, emoções',
    'e atitudes mentais que caracterizam a nossa',
    'época são realmente destinados a sustentar',
    'a mística do Partido e impedir que se perceba',
    'a verdadeira natureza da sociedade atual.',
    'A rebelião física não é possível',
    'no momento, nem qualquer preliminar de rebelião.',
    'Dos proletários nada há a temer. Entregues',
    'a si mesmos, continuarão, de geração',
    'em geração e de século a século,',
    'trabalhando, procriando e morrendo, não',
    'apenas sem qualquer impulso de rebeldia,',
    'como sem capacidade de descobrir que o mundo',
    'poderia ser diferente do que é. Só poderiam',
    'ficar mais perigosos se o progresso da técnica',
    'industrial tornasse necessário educá-los',
    'mais; porém, como a rivalidade militar',
    'e comercial não tem mais importância,',
    'declina o nível da educação popular.',
    'As opiniões das massas, ou a ausência',
    'dessas opiniões, são alvo da máxima',
    'indiferença. Não é possível dar-lhes',
    'liberdade intelectual porque não possuem',
    'intelecto. Num membro do Partido, por outro',
    'lado, não se pode tolerar nem o menor desvio',
    'de opinião a respeito do assunto menos',
    'importante. O membro do Partido vive, do',
    'berço à cova, sob os olhos da Polícia',
    'do Pensamento. Mesmo quando está sózinho',
    'jamais pode ter certeza do seu isolamento.',
    'Onde quer que esteja, dormindo ou acordado,',
    'trabalhando ou descansando, no banho ou na',
    'cama, pode ser examinado sem aviso e sem',
    'saber que o examinam. Nada do que ele faz',
    'é indiferente. Suas amizades, seus divertimentos,',
    'sua conduta em relação a esposa e aos',
    'filhos, a expressão de seu rosto quando',
    'está só, as palavras que murmura no sono,',
    'e até os movimentos característicos do',
    'seu corpo, é tudo ciosamente analisado.',
    'é certo que descobrem não apenas as mais',
    'minúsculas infrações, como qualquer',
    'excentricidade, por pequena que seja, qualquer',
    'modificação de hábitos, qualquer maneirismo',
    'nervoso que possa ser o sintoma duma luta',
    'íntima. Não tem liberdade de escôlha',
    'em direção alguma. Por outro lado, seus',
    'atos não são regulados pela lei nem por',
    'nenhum código legal, claramente formulado.',
    'Na Oceania não existe lei. Pensamentos',
    'e atos que, descobertos, resultariam em morte',
    'certa, não são formalmente proibidos,',
    'e os intermináveis expurgos, prisões,',
    'torturas, detenções e vaporizações',
    'não são infligidos como castigo por crimes',
    'realmente cometidos, mas são apenas a liquidação',
    'de pessoas que poderiam talvez cometer um',
    'crime no futuro. O membro do Partido não',
    'só deve ter as opiniões certas, como',
    'os instintos certos. Muitas das crenças',
    'e atitudes dele exigidas não são nunca',
    'declaradas abertamente, e não poderiam',
    'ser esmiuçadas sem pôr a nú as contradições',
    'inerentes do Ingsoc. Se for uma pessoa naturalmente',
    'ortodoxa (em Novilíngua bempensante), saberá,',
    'em todas as circunstâncias, sem precisar',
    'raciocinar, qual é a verdadeira crença',
    'e a emoção desejável. Mas, de qualquer',
    'maneira, um trabalhoso treino mental, a que',
    'se submeteu na infância, e que gira em',
    'tôrno das palavras novilinguísticas crimedeter,',
    'negrobranco e duplipensar, faz com que ele',
    'não tenha nem disposição nem capacidade',
    'para pensar a fundo em coisa alguma. Espera-se',
    'que o membro do Partido não tenha emoções',
    'pessoais nem lapsos de entusiasmo. Supõe-se',
    'que viva num frenesi contínuo de ódio',
    'aos inimigos estrangeiros e aos traidores',
    'internos, de gôzo ante as vitórias e',
    'de autodegradação perante o poderio e',
    'a sabedoria do Partido. Os descontentamentos',
    'produzidos por essa vida nua e insatisfatória',
    'são deliberadamente purgados e dissipados',
    'por estratagemas tais como os Dois Minutos',
    'de ódio, e as especulações que poderiam',
    'vir a induzir uma atitude de cepticismo ou',
    'de rebeldia são antecipadamente suprimidas',
    'pela disciplina aprendida na infância.',
    'O primeiro e mais simples estágio dessa',
    'disciplina, e pelo qual passam até as crianças',
    'de tenra idade, chama-se, em Novilíngua,',
    'crimedeter. Crimedeter é a faculdade de',
    'deter, de paralisar, como por instinto, no',
    'limiar, qualquer pensamento perigoso. Inclui',
    'o poder de não perceber analogias, de não',
    'conseguir observar erros de lógica, de',
    'não compreender os argumentos mais simples',
    'e hostis ao Ingsoc, e de se aborrecer ou',
    'enojar por qualquer trem de pensamentos que',
    'possa tomar rumo herético. Crimedeter,',
    'em suma, significa estupidez protetora. Mas',
    'estupidez não basta. Pelo contrário,',
    'a ortodoxia, na sua expressão lata, exige',
    'sobre o processo mental do indivíduo controle',
    'tão completo quanto o de um contorcionista',
    'sobre seu corpo. Em última análise, a',
    'sociedade oceânica repousa na crença',
    'de que o Grande Irmão é onipotente e',
    'o Partido infalível. Mas como na realidade',
    'nem o Grande Irmão é onipotente nem o',
    'Partido infalível, é preciso haver uma',
    'incansável flexibilidade, de momento a',
    'momento, na interpretação dos fatos.',
    'Aqui, a palavra chave é negrobranco. Como',
    'tantas outras palavras da Novilíngua, esta',
    'tem dois sentidos mútuamente contraditórios.',
    'Aplicada a um adversário, caracteriza o',
    'hábito de afirmar impudentemente que o',
    'negro é branco, em contradição aos',
    'fatos evidentes. Aplicada a um membro do',
    'Partido, significa leal disposição de',
    'dizer que o preto é branco quando o Partido',
    'o exige. Significa, também, a capacidade',
    'de acreditar que o preto é branco, e mais',
    'ainda, de saber que o preto é branco, e',
    'de acreditar que jamais se imaginou o contrário.',
    'Isto exige contínua alteração do passado,',
    'possibilitada pelo sistema de raciocínio',
    'que na verdade abrange tudo o mais, e que',
    'em Novilíngua se chama duplipensar. A alteração',
    'do passado é necessária por duas razões,',
    'uma das quais é subsidiária e, por assim',
    'dizer, precautória. A razão subsidiária',
    'é de que o membro do Partido, como o proletário,',
    'tolera as condições atuais em parte por',
    'não possuir padrões da comparação.',
    'Deve ser isolado do passado, da mesma forma',
    'que deve ser isolado do estrangeiro, porque',
    'lhe é necessário crer que vive melhor',
    'que os ancestrais e que o nível médio',
    'de confôrto material sobe constantemente.',
    'Todavia, a razão mais importante para o',
    'reajuste do passado é a necessidade de',
    'salvaguardar a infalibilidade do Partido.',
    'Não significa apenas que se modifiquem',
    'discursos, estatísticas e registros de',
    'todo gênero para demonstrar que as predições',
    'do Partido são sempre certas. é que não',
    'se pode admitir, jamais, nenhuma modificação',
    'de doutrina ou de agrupamento político.',
    'Mudar de idéia, ou de política, é confessar',
    'fraqueza. Se, por exemplo, a Eurásia ou',
    'a Lestásia (qualquer das duas) for a inimiga',
    'de hoje, então aquele país deve ter sido',
    'sempre o inimigo. E se os fatos dizem coisas',
    'diferentes, então é preciso alterá-los.',
    'Assim se reescreve continuamente a história.',
    'Essa falsificação cotidiana do passado,',
    'realizada pelo Ministério da Verdade, é',
    'tão necessária à estabilidade do regime',
    'como o trabalho de repressão e espionagem',
    'levado a cabo pelo Ministério do Amor.',
    'A mutabilidade do passado é o dogma central',
    'do Ingsoc. Argúe- se que os acontecimentos',
    'passados não têm existência objetiva,',
    'porém só sobrevivem em registros escritos',
    'e na memória humana. O passado é o que',
    'dizem os registros e as memórias. E como',
    'o Partido tem pleno controle de todos os',
    'registros, e igualmente do cérebro dos',
    'seus membros, segue-se que o passado é',
    'o que o Partido deseja que seja. Segue-se',
    'também que embora o passado seja alterável,',
    'jamais foi alterado num caso específico.',
    'Pois quando é re-escrito na forma conveniente,',
    'a nova versão passa a ser o passado, e',
    'nada diferente pode ter existido. Isto se',
    'aplica mesmo quando, como acontece com freqüência,',
    'o mesmo sucesso tem de ser alterado várias',
    'vezes no decurso de um ano. Tôdas as vezes',
    'o Partido é detentor da verdade absoluta,',
    'e claramente o absoluto não pode nunca',
    'ser diferente do que é agora, Ver- se-á',
    'que o controle do passado depende, acima',
    'de tudo, do treino da memória. Não passa',
    'de ato mecânico certificarse de que todos',
    'os registros escritos concordam com a ortodoxia',
    'do momento. Mas também é necessário',
    'recordar que os acontecimentos se deram da',
    'maneira desejada. E se for necessário rearranjar',
    'as lembranças de cada um, ou alterar os',
    'registros escritos, então é necessário',
    'esquecer que assim se procedeu. êsse é',
    'um truque que pode ser aprendido como se',
    'aprende qualquer outra técnica mental.',
    'é aprendido pela maioria dos membros do',
    'Partido e certamente por todos que são',
    'tão inteligentes quanto ortodoxos. Em Anticlíngua',
    'chama-se, com toda a franqueza, "controle',
    'da realidade." Em Novilíngua, chama-se',
    'duplipensar, conquanto duplipensar abranja',
    'muita coisa mais. Duplipensar quer dizer',
    'a capacidade de guardar simultaneamente na',
    'cabeça duas crenças contraditórias,',
    'e aceitá-las ambas. O intelectual do Partido',
    'sabe em que direção suas lembranças',
    'devem ser alteradas; portanto sabe que está',
    'aplicando um truque na realidade; mas pelo',
    'exercício do duplipensar ele se convence',
    'também de que a realidade não está',
    'sendo violada. O processo tem de ser consciente,',
    'ou não seria realizado com a precisão',
    'suficiente, mas também deve ser inconsciente,',
    'ou provocaria uma sensação de falsidade',
    'e, portanto, de culpa. O duplipensar é',
    'a pedra basilar do Ingsoc, já que a ação',
    'essencial do Partido é usar a fraude conscienté',
    'ao mesmo tempo que conserva a firmeza de',
    'propósito que acompanha a honestidade completa.',
    'Dizer mentiras deliberadas e nelas acreditar',
    'piamente, esquecer qualquer fato que se haja',
    'tornado inconveniente, e depois, quando de',
    'novo se tornar preciso, arrancá-lo do olvido',
    'o tempo suficiente à sua utilidade, negar',
    'a existência da realidade objetiva e ao',
    'mesmo tempo perceber a realidade que se nega',
    '- tudo isso é indispensável. Mesmo no',
    'emprêgo da palavra duplipensar é necessário',
    'duplipensar. Pois, usando-se a palavra admite-se',
    'que se está mexendo na realidade; é preciso',
    'um novo ato de duplipensar para apagar essa',
    'percepção e assim por diante, indefinidamente,',
    'a mentira sempre um passo além da realidade.',
    'Em última análise, foi por meio do duplipensar',
    'que o Partido conseguiu, e, tanto quanto',
    'sabemos, continuará, milhares de anos -',
    'deter o curso da história. No passado,',
    'as oligarquias cairam do poder por se ossificarem',
    'ou se amolecerem. Ou se tornaram estúpidas',
    'e arrogantes, deixando de se ajustar às',
    'novas circunstâncias, e foram derribadas;',
    'ou se tornaram liberais e covardes, fizeram',
    'concessões quando deviam ter usado fôrça,',
    'e por isso foram apeadas do poder. Em outras',
    'palavras, cairam pela consciência ou a',
    'inconsciencia. A grande obra do Partido é',
    'ter produzido um sistema de pensamento no',
    'qual ambas as condições podem co- existir.',
    'Não poderia ser permanente o dominio do',
    'Partido em nenhuma outra base intelectual.',
    'Para se dominar, e continuar dominando, é',
    'preciso deslocar o sentido de realidade.',
    'Pois o segredo do mando é combinar a crença',
    'na própria infalibilidade com a capacidade',
    'de aprender com os erros anteriores. Não',
    'há quase necessidade de dizer que os mais',
    'sutis praticantes do duplipensar são os',
    'que o inventaram e sabem que é um vasto',
    'sistema de fraude mental. Em nossa sociedade,',
    'os que têm o melhor conhecimento do que',
    'sucede são também os que estão mais',
    'longe de ver o mundo tal qual é. Em geral,',
    'quanto maior a compreensão, maior a ilusão:',
    'quanto mais inteligente, menos ajuizado.',
    'Nítida ilustração desta afirmativa',
    'é o fato da histeria de guerra aumentar',
    'de intensidade à medida que se sobe na',
    'escala social. Aqueles cuja atitude em face',
    'da guerra é mais próxima da sensatez',
    'são povos submissos dos territórios disputados.',
    'Para eles a guerra não passa de uma calamidade',
    'contínua que se diverte a jogá-los de',
    'um lado para outro como um maremoto. é-Ihes',
    'completamente indiferente saber quem está',
    'ganhando. Percebem que a mudança de donos',
    'significa apenas que farão o mesmo trabalho',
    'que antes para os novos amos, que os tratarão',
    'como os tratavam os antigos. Os operários',
    'ligeiramente mais favorecidos a que chamamos',
    '"proles" têm consciencia intermitente da',
    'guerra. Quando é necessário, são instigados',
    'e levados a frenesís de ódio e medo,',
    'mas, entregues a si próprios, são capazes',
    'de esquecer, por longos períodos, que a',
    'guerra está acontecendo. é nas fileiras',
    'do Partido, e acima de tudo do Partido Interno,',
    'que se encontra o verdadeiro entusiasmo de',
    'guerra. Acreditam na conquista do mundo,',
    'com maior firmeza, aqueles que a sabem impossível.',
    'êsse particularíssimo amálgama de opostos',
    '- sabedoria e ignorância, cinismo e fanatismo',
    '- é um dos sinais que distínguem a sociedade',
    'oceânica. A ideologia oficial abunda em',
    'contradições mesmo onde não há para',
    'elas qualquer razão prática. Assim, o',
    'Partido rejeita e vilifica qualquer princípio',
    'originalmente defendido pelo movimento socialista,',
    'e no entanto o faz em nome do socialismo.',
    'Prega um desdém pela classe operária',
    'de que não há exemplo há muitos séculos,',
    'e todavia veste os militantes num uniforme',
    'que foi característico dos trabalhadores',
    'manuais e adotado por essa razão. Mina',
    'sistemàticamente a solidariedade da família,',
    'ao passado que dá ao seu chefe um nome',
    'que é um apelo direto ao sentimento de',
    'lealdade familiar. Até os nomes dos quatro',
    'Ministérios por que somos governados ostentam',
    'uma espécie de impudência na sua deliberada',
    'subversão dos fatos. O Ministério da',
    'Paz ocupa-se da guerra, o da Verdade com',
    'as mentiras, o do Amor com a tortura e o',
    'da Fartura com a fome. Essas contradições',
    'não são acidentais, nem resultam de hipocrisia',
    'ordinária: são exercícios conscientes',
    'de duplipensar. Pois é só reconcíliando',
    'contradições que se pode reter indefinidamente',
    'o poder. De nenhuma outra maneira seria possível',
    'quebrar o antigo ciclo. Se é preciso impedir',
    'para sempre a igualdade humana, se, como',
    'a chamamos, a Alta deve conservar permanentemente',
    'sua posição, então a condição',
    'mental deve ser a de insânia controlada.',
    'Mas há outra questão que, até êste',
    'momento, não consideramos. E é esta:',
    'por que se deve impedir a igualdade humana?',
    'Suponhamos que tenha sido bem descrita a',
    'mecânica do processo: qual é o motivo',
    'dêsse vasto e bem calculado esfôrço',
    'para congelar a história num determinado',
    'instante? Aqui chegamos ao segrêdo central.',
    'Como vimos, a mística do Partido e, acima',
    'de tudo, do Partido Interno, depende do duplipensar.',
    'Mais fundo do que isto, porém, há o motivo',
    'original, o instinto jamais posto em dúvida,',
    'que primeiro levou à conquista do poder',
    'e gerou o duplipensar, a Polícia do Pensamento,',
    'a guerra contínua e todo o restante equipamento',
    'necessário. êsse motivo realmente consiste.',
    '.. Winston dera-se conta do silêncio, como',
    'quem percebe um novo som. Parecia-lhe que',
    'Júlia estava muito quieta havia bastante',
    'tempo. Estava deitada de lado, nua da cintura',
    'para cima, com a face apoiada na mão e',
    'um cacho de cabelo castanho caido sobre os',
    'olhos. O peito subia e descia com regularidade.',
    '- Júlia? Nenhuma resposta., Júlia, estás',
    'acordada? Nenhuma resposta. Estava dormindo.',
    'Ele fechou o livro, pousou-o cuidadosamente',
    'no soalho, deitou-se e puxou a colcha sobre',
    'ambos. Refletiu que ainda não aprendera',
    'o segrêdo final. Compreendia como; ainda',
    'não entendia por que. O Capítulo I, como',
    'o III, não lhe dissera nada que já não',
    'soubesse; apenas sistematizara o conhecimento',
    'que já possuía. Mas depois de lê-lo',
    'tinha maior certeza de não estar louco.',
    'Estar em minoria, mesmo em minoria de um,',
    'não era sintoma de loucura. Havia verdade',
    'e havia mentira, e não se está louco',
    'porque se insiste em se agarrar à verdade',
    'mesmo contra o mundo todo. Um raio amarelo',
    'do sol poente penetrou em oblíqua pela',
    'janela e iluminou o travesseiro. Ele fechou',
    'os olhos. O sol no rosto e o corpo macio',
    'da moça, encostado ao seu, davam-lhe um',
    'forte sentimento de sonolência e confiança.',
    'Estava em segurança, e tudo ia bem. Adormeceu',
    'murmurando "A sanidade mental não é questão',
    'de estatística", e com a impressão de',
    'que essas palavras continham profunda sabedoria.',
    'Quando acordou, teve a sensação de ter',
    'dormido longo tempo, porém uma consulta',
    'ao antigo relógio mostrou-lhe que eram',
    'apenas vinte e trinta. Deixou-se ficar na',
    'cama alguns instantes. Depois, a cantoria',
    'costumeira, forte e rija, subiu do quintal:',
    '"Foi apenas uma fantasia desesperada, Que',
    'passou como um dia de abril, Mas um olhar,',
    'uma palavra, e os sonhos provocados, Roubaram',
    'o meu coração gentil!" A cantiga pueril',
    'parecia ter conservado a popularidade. Ainda',
    'se fazia ouvir por toda parte. Sobrevivera',
    'a Canção do ódio. Júlia acordou com',
    'o barulho, espreguiçou-se como uma gata',
    'e pulou da cama., Estou com fome!, anunciou.',
    '- Vamos fazer um café. Bolas! O fogareiro',
    'apagou e a água esfriou!, Apanhou o fogareiro',
    'e sacudiu-o., Está vazio., Creio que',
    'o velho Charrington pode arranjar um pouco',
    'de óleo., O engraçado é que eu verifiquei',
    'que estava cheio. Vou me vestir, acrescentou',
    'ela., Parece que esfriou um pouco. Winston',
    'também se levantou e vestiu-se. A voz infatigável',
    '- cantou: "Dizem que o tempo tudo cura, Dizem',
    'que sempre se pode esquecer, Mas os sorrisos',
    'e lágrimas anos a fio, Ainda fazem meu',
    'coração sofrer." Prendendo o cinto, ele',
    'foi até a janela. O sol devia ter-se escondido',
    'atrás das casas. Já não brilhava no',
    'quintal. Os paralelepípedos estavam molhados,',
    'como se tivessem sido lavados, e ele teve',
    'a impressão de que o céu também fora',
    'lavado, tão fresco e pálido era o azul',
    'entre as coifas das chaminés. Incansável,',
    'a mulher marchava daqui para acolá, arrolhando',
    'e desarrolhando a boca com os prendedores,',
    'cantando e emudecendo, estendendo mais fraldas,',
    'e mais e mais. Ele se indagou se a mulher',
    'era lavadeira profissional ou apenas a escrava',
    'de vinte ou trinta netos. Júlia viera juntar-se',
    'a ele; juntos contemplavam, com um certo',
    'fascínio, a figura reforçada da prole.',
    'Fitando a mulher na sua atitude característica,',
    'os braços grossos alcançando o varal,',
    'as ancas muito salientes, fortes, como as',
    'de uma égua, ele achou, pela primeira vez,',
    'que ela era bonita. Antes, nunca lhe havia',
    'ocorrido que pudesse ser belo o corpo de',
    'uma mulher de cinqüenta anos, ampliado',
    'a monstruosas dimensões pelos partos sucessivos,',
    'depois enrijada, calejada pelo trabalho até',
    'ficar grosseira como um nabo muito maduro.',
    'Mas era, e afinal, pensou ele, por que não?',
    'O corpo sólido, sem contornos, como um',
    'bloco de granito, e a pele vermelha arrepiada,',
    'representavam o mesmo, em relação ao',
    'corpo de Júlia, que o fruto de uma rosa',
    'brava junto à rosa de jardim. Por que seria',
    'o fruto considerado inferior à flor? -',
    'Ela é bonita!, murmurou ele., Tem um',
    'metro de diâmetro, nas cadeiras, disse',
    'Júlia., é o seu estilo de beleza, respondeu',
    'Winston. Ele passou o braço em tôrno',
    'da cintura fina de Júlia. Do quadril ao',
    'joelho, o flanco da moça colava-se ao dele.',
    'Dos seus corpos não sairia filho algum.',
    'Era a única coisa que nunca poderiam fazer.',
    'Só pela palavra oral, e pela comunicação',
    'mental podiam transmitir o segredo. A mulher',
    'do quintal não tinha mente, só tinha',
    'braços fortes, coração quente, ventre',
    'fértil. Ele gostaría de saber quantos',
    'filhos ela tivera. Talvez quinze, fàcilmente.',
    'Tivera o seu floramento momentâneo, um',
    'ano talvez, de beleza de rosa brava, e depois,',
    'inchara de repente, como um fruto fertilizado,',
    'tornando-se dura, vermelha e rústica, e',
    'a sua vida fora apenas lavar, esfregar, remendar,',
    'cozinhar, varrer, polir, consertar, esfregar,',
    'lavar, primeiro para os fílhos, depois',
    'para os netos, durante trinta anos sem interrupção.',
    'E no fim ainda cantava. A reverência mística',
    'que Winston por ela sentia misturava-se,',
    'de certo modo, com o aspecto do céu pálido',
    'e sem nuvens, dilatando-se, por trás das',
    'chaminés, e atingindo distâncias intermináveis.',
    'Era curioso pensar que o céu era o mesmo',
    'para todos, na Eurásia como na Lestásia,',
    'como na Oceania. E o povo que vivia sob o',
    'céu era também muito parecido, por tôda',
    'parte, em todo o mundo, centenas ou milhares',
    'de milhões de pessoas exatamente assim,',
    'ignorantes da existência dos outros, separadas',
    'por muralhas de ódios e mentiras, e no\'entanto',
    'quase exatamente iguais, gente que nunca',
    'aprendera a pensar mas guardava no coração,',
    'no ventre e nos músculos a força que',
    'um dia revolucionaria o mundo. Se esperança',
    'havia, estava nos proles! Sem ler o livro',
    'até o fim, sabia que devia ser essa a mensagem',
    'final de Goldstein. O futuro pertencia aos',
    'proles. E poderia ter a certeza de que, quando',
    'chegasse o momento, o mundo que construiriam',
    'não lhe seria tão alheio, a ele, a Winston',
    'Smith, quanto o mundo do Partido? Sim, porque',
    'ao menos seria um mundo de sanidade mental.',
    'Onde há igualdade, há sanidade. Mais',
    'cedo ou mais tarde aconteceria: a força',
    'se transformaria em consciência. Os proles',
    'eram imortais; não era possível duvidar-se,',
    'fitando a valente figura da mulher no pátio.',
    'Por fim chegaria o seu despertar. E até',
    'que isso acontecesse, nem que levasse mil',
    'anos para acontecer, agüentariam vivos',
    'contra tudo, como os pássaros, transmitindo',
    'de corpo a corpo a vitalidade que o Partido',
    'não possuía e que não podia matar.',
    '- Lembras-te do tordo, perguntou ele, que',
    'cantou para nós, o primeiro dia, na borda',
    'do bosque?, Não estava cantando para nós,',
    '- disse Júlia., Estava cantando para se',
    'distrair. Nem isso. Apenas cantava. Os pássaros',
    'cantavam, os proles cantavam, o Partido não',
    'cantava. No mundo inteiro, em Londres e em',
    'Nova York, na áfrica e no Brasil e nas',
    'terras misteriosas e proibidas de além-fronteiras,',
    'nas ruas de Paris e Berlim, nas aldeias da',
    'infindável planície russa, nos bazares',
    'da China e do Japão, em toda parte a mesma',
    'figura sólida, invencível, que o trabalho',
    'e os partos sucessivos haviam tornado monstruosa-',
    'trabalhando desde nascer até morrer, e',
    'sempre cantando. Daqueles corpos robustos',
    'viria um dia uma raça de seres conscientes.',
    'O futuro era deles. Mas era possível participar',
    'dêsse futuro mantendo o espírito vivo',
    'como eles mantinham o corpo, e passar adiante',
    'a doutrina secreta de que dois e dois são',
    'quatro., Nós somos os mortos, disse ele.',
    '- Nós somos os mortos, repetiu Júlia,',
    'lealmente., Vós sois os mortos, ecoou',
    'uma voz de ferro, por trás deles. Separaram-se',
    'num pulo. As entranhas de Winston pareciam',
    'ter gelado. Podia ver todo o branco dos olhos',
    'de Júlia. cuja face adquirira um tom amarelo',
    'leitoso. A mancha de ruge, ainda nas faces,',
    'destacava-se vivamente, como se não tocasse',
    'a pele que tinha por baixo. Sois os mortos',
    '- repetiu a voz de ferro. Foi atrás do',
    'quadro, sussurrou Júlia., Foi atrás',
    'do quadro, confirmou a voz., Ficai exatamente',
    'onde estais. Não vos mexais enquanto não',
    'receberdes ordem. Começava, por fim começava!',
    'Nada podiam fazer, exceto olhos entrefitar',
    'nos olhos. Correr, fugir da casa antes que',
    'fosse tarde demais, essa idéia não lhes',
    'ocorreu. Incrível desobedecer à voz de',
    'ferro da parede. Houve um estalido, como',
    'se tivesse corrido um ferrolho, e um tilintar',
    'de vidro quebrado. O quadro caira ao chão,',
    'revelando uma teletela., Agora, podem enxergar',
    'a gente, disse Júlia., Agora podemos',
    'vos enxergar, disse a voz., Ficai no meio',
    'do quarto, um de costas para o outro. Juntai',
    'as mãos na nuca. Não vos toqueis. Não',
    'se tocavam, e no entanto pareceu a Winston',
    'que podia sentir o tremor do corpo de Júlia.',
    'Ou talvez fosse o seu próprio. Mal podia',
    'impedir os dentes de chocalharem, mas os',
    'joelhos não obedeciam ao seu controle.',
    'Ouviram-se botas ferradas marchando lá',
    'baixo, dentro e fora da casa. O pátio parecia',
    'cheio de homens. Algo parecia estar rolando',
    'sobre o lagedo. O cântico da mulher parara',
    'abruptamente. Houve um barulho metálico,',
    'prolongado, arrastado, como se a tina de',
    'roupa tivesse sido jogada de um lado a outro',
    'do quintal. Depois uma confusão de gritos',
    'furiosos que acabaram num uivo de dor. -',
    'A casa está cercada, disse Winston. -',
    'A casa está cercada, repetiu a voz. Ouviu',
    'Júlia trincar os dentes. Creio que é',
    'melhor a gente se despedir disse éla. é',
    'melhor vos despedirdes, disse a voz. E depois',
    'üma voz completamente diferente, fina,',
    'culta, e que deu a Wínston a impressão',
    'de já a haver ouvido nalguma parte:, E',
    'por falar nisso, já que falamos do assunto,',
    'Aí vem uma luz para te levar para a cama,',
    'Aí vem um machado para te cortar a cabeça!\'',
    'Algo caíra na cama, por trás de Winston.',
    'A ponta de uma escada fora metida pela vidraça',
    'e quebrara o caixilho. Alguém entrava pela',
    'janela. Ouviu-se um tropel de botas que subiam',
    'por dentro da casa. O quarto encheu-se de',
    'homens robustos, de uniformes negros, botas',
    'ferradas nos pés e bastões nas mãos.',
    'Winston já não tremia. Mal mexia os olhos.',
    'Só uma coisa lhe importava: ficar muito',
    'quieto, ficar imóvel, para não lhes dar',
    'pretexto para espancá-lo! Um homem de cara',
    'lisa, de pugilista, em que a boca não passava',
    'de uma frincha, parou diante dele, brandindo',
    'o bastão com ar pensativo. Winston fitou-o',
    'nos olhos. Era quase insuportável a impressão',
    'de nudez, as mãos na nuca, o rosto e o',
    'corpo expostos. O homem mostrou a ponta da',
    'língua branca, umedeceu o lugar onde deveriam',
    'estar os lábios, e passou adiante. Houve',
    'outro estrondo. Alguém apanhara o peso',
    'de papel da mesa e o arrebentara de encontro',
    'à lareira. O fragmento de coral, uma partícula',
    'crespa de rosa, como um enfeite de bolo,',
    'rolou pelo capacho. Que pequenino, pensou',
    'Winston, como sempre fora pequenino! Houve',
    'uma exclamação e um baque, atrás dele,',
    'e levou um pontapé no tornozelo que quase',
    'o fez perder o equilíbrio. Um dos homens',
    'desferira um murro no plexo de Júlia, fazendo-a',
    'dobrar-se em dois como um canivete. Rolava',
    'pelo chão, ofegante. Winston não ousava',
    'virar a cabeça nem um milímetro, mas',
    'de vez em quando o rosto lívido da moça',
    'entrava no seu campo de visão. Em meio',
    'ao seu terror, tinha a impressão de poder',
    'sentir a dor no seu próprio corpo, a dor',
    'fatal que no entanto era menos ansiosa que',
    'a luta de Júlia para recobrar o fôlego.',
    'Ele sabia como era: a dor terrível, agoniante,',
    'presente o tempo todo mas que não podia',
    'ainda ser sofrida porque, antes de tudo,',
    'era necessário respirar. Então dois homens',
    'a suspenderam pelos ombros e joelhos e a',
    'levaram para fora do quarto, como um saco.',
    'Winston viu-a de relance, cabeça para baixo,',
    'amarela e contorcida, olhos fechados, e ainda',
    'com uma mancha de ruge em cada face; foi',
    'a última vez que viu Júlia. Continuou',
    'imóvel. Ainda ninguém o esbordoara. Pensamentos',
    'que surgiam por si mesmos, mas que pareciam',
    'totalmente desinteressantes, começaram',
    'a revolutear na sua cabeça. Teriam apanhado',
    'também o sr. Charrington? Que teriam feito',
    'com a lavadeira do quintal? Reparou que tinha',
    'urgente vontade de urinar, e sentiu-se ligeiramente',
    'surpreso, porque se aliviara havia apenas',
    'duas ou três horas. Observou que o velho',
    'relógio da lareira marcava nove, significando',
    'vinte e uma horas. Mas a luz lhe parecia',
    'forte demais. Já não deveria estar esmorecendo',
    'às vinte e uma, em agosto? Seria possível',
    'que ele e Júlia se tivessem enganado -',
    'dormido mais de 10 horas e acreditado que',
    'fossem vinte e trinta quando na verdade eram',
    'oito e trinta da manhã seguinte? Não',
    'prosseguiu no raciocínio. Não interessava.',
    'Outro passo, mais ligeiro, se fez ouvir no',
    'corredor. O sr. Charrington entrou no quarto.',
    'De repente, tornou-se mais cortês a conduta',
    'dos homens de uniforme negro. Na aparência',
    'do sr. Charrington algo também se modificara.',
    'Seu olhar tombou sobre os fragmentos do peso',
    'de papéis., Recolhe êsses pedaços',
    '- disse, imperiosamente. O homem abaixou-se',
    'e obedeceu. O sotaque londrino desaparecera;',
    'Winston repentinamente percebeu de quem era',
    'a voz que ouvira, não havia muito, pela',
    'teletela. O sr. Charrington ainda usava o',
    'paletó de veludo velho; mas o cabelo, antes',
    'quase todo grisalho, enegrecera de novo.',
    'Não usava mais óculos. Lançou a Winston',
    'um olhar único, percuciente, como se lhe',
    'verificasse a identidade, e não tornou',
    'a lhe dar atenção. Ainda era reconhecível,',
    'mas não era mais a mesma pessoa. O corpo',
    'se endireitara e ele parecia maior, mais',
    'alto. A face sofrera apenas modificações',
    'minúsculas que, no entanto, haviam operado',
    'completa transformação. As sobrancelhas',
    'negras eram menos bastas, as rugas tinham',
    'sumido, e toda a fisionomia parecera se alterar;',
    'até o nariz parecia mais curto. Era o rosto',
    'alerta e frio de um homem de seus trinta',
    'e cinco anos. E a Winston ocorreu que pela',
    'primeira vez na vida punha os olhos num componente',
    'da Polícia do Pensamento. 18 NãO SABIA',
    'ONDE ESTAVA. PRESUMIVELMENTE NO Ministério',
    'do Amor; mas não havia jeito de o verificar.',
    'Encontrava-se numa cela de alto pé-direito,',
    'sem janelas, de paredes de porcelana branca',
    'e brilhante. Lâmpadas ocultas inundavam-na',
    'de luz fria, e havia um zumbido baixo, constante,',
    'que ele supôs ter relação com o sistema',
    'de ar. Um banco, ou prateleira, de largura',
    'apenas suficiente para se sentar, circundava',
    'toda a parede, interrompendo-se apenas na',
    'porta e, em frente à porta, um vaso de',
    'privada, sem tampo. Havia quatro teletelas,',
    'uma em cada parede. Sentia uma dor surda',
    'na barriga. Sofria desde que o haviam metido',
    'no caminhão fechado e levado embora. Mas',
    'também sentia fome, uma fome horrível,',
    'devoradora. Vinte e quatro horas talvez se',
    'haviam passado desde que comera por último,',
    'quem sabe, trinta e seis. Ainda não sabia,',
    'provavelmente jamais saberia, se fora preso',
    'de manhã ou de noite. E desde que fora',
    'preso não lhe haviam dado de comer. Estava',
    'sentado, tão imóvel quanto possível,',
    'no banco estreito, as mãos pousadas nos',
    'joelhos. Já aprendera a sentar quieto.',
    'Se fizesse movimentos inesperados, gritavam-lhe',
    'da teletela. Mas a fome crescia. O que mais',
    'ambicionava era um pedaço de pão. Teve',
    'a idéia de que sobravam umas migalhas nos',
    'bolsos da roupa. Era possível até, pensava',
    'nisso porque de vez em quando algo lhe parecia',
    'fazer cócegas na perna, que tivesse um',
    'bom pedaço de côdea. Por fim, a tentação',
    'venceu o medo. Meteu a mão no bolsão.',
    'Smith!, berrou uma voz da teletela., 6079',
    'Smith W! Tira a mão do bolso! Tornou a',
    'ficar imóvel, mãos cruzadas no joelho.',
    'Antes de ter sido levado para ali, haviam-no',
    'conduzido a outro lugar, que devia ser uma',
    'prisão comum, ou um depósito temporário',
    'utilizado pela patrulha. Não sabia quanto',
    'tempo lá ficara; algumas horas, ao menos;',
    'sem relógio e sem luz do sol era difícil',
    'calcular o tempo. Era um lugar barulhento,',
    'mal cheiroso. Tinham-no trancafiado numa',
    'cela semelhante à que estava agora, mas',
    'imunda, e às vezes cheia, com dez ou quinze',
    'pessoas. A maioria era de criminosos comuns,',
    'porém havia alguns presos políticos.',
    'Ele sentara-se em silêncio junto à parede,',
    'roçado pelos corpos sujos, muito cheio',
    'de medo e de dor de- barriga para se interessar',
    'pelo ambiente, mas ainda notando a tremenda',
    'diferença de comportamento entre os presos',
    'do Partido e os outros. Os presos do Partido',
    'estavam sempre calados e aterrorizados, porém',
    'os criminosos comuns pareciam não ligar',
    'a mínima a ninguém. Insultavam os guardas',
    'aos gritos, resistiam desesperadamente quando',
    'os seus bens eram arrolados, escreviam palavras',
    'obscenas no chão, comiam alimento contrabandeado',
    'que tiravam de misteriosos esconderijos das',
    'roupas, e até faziam as teletelas calar,',
    'gritando em uníssono, quando o aparelho',
    'tentava restaurar a ordem. Por outro lado,',
    'alguns pareciam ter boas relações com',
    'os guardas, a quem chamavam por apelidos,',
    'e tentavam passar cigarros pela vigia da',
    'porta. Os guardas, também, tratavam os',
    'criminosos comuns com certo respeito, mesmo',
    'quando lhes davam uns safanões. Falava-se',
    'muito dos campos de trabalhos forçados,',
    'aos quais a maioria dos prisioneiros esperava',
    'ser enviada. "Tudo azul" nos campos, afirmaram-lhe,',
    'contanto que tivesse bons contactos e conhecesse',
    'os truques. Havia suborno, favoritismo e',
    'roubalheira de todo gênero, havia homossexualidade',
    'e prostituição, havia até álcool',
    'ilícito, distilado de batatas. Os cargos',
    'de confiança eram dados apenas aos criminosos',
    'comuns, especialmente gangsters e os assassinos,',
    'que formavam uma espécie de aristocracia.',
    'Todo trabalho sujo era feito pelos políticos.',
    'Havia um contínuo fluxo e refluxo de presos',
    'de todo gênero: vendedores de entorpecentes,',
    'ladrões, bandidos, mercadonegristas, bêbados,',
    'prostitutas. Alguns bêbados eram tão',
    'violentos que os companheiros de cela tinham',
    'de juntar forças para dominá-los. Uma',
    'mulheraça de uns sessenta anos, de enormes',
    'seios como pêndulos, e grossas melenas',
    'de cabelo branco esgrouviado, foi levada',
    'para a cela, gritando e dando pontapés,',
    'por quatro guardas que a seguravam pelos',
    'braços e pernas. Arrancaram as botinas',
    'com que ela tentara atingi-los e jogaram-na',
    'no colo de Winston, quase quebrando seus',
    'fêmures. @A mulher ergueu-se e cumprimentou-lhes',
    'a saída com um grito de "Filhos da p.',
    '!" Depois, percebendo que estava sentada',
    'nalguma coisa incômoda, escorreu dos joelhos',
    'de Winston para o banco., Desculpe, queridinho.',
    'Eu não sentaria em cima de você, foram',
    'os sacanas que me botaram aí. Não sabem',
    'nem tratar uma senhora, sabem?, Fez uma',
    'pausa, bateu no peito, e arrotou., Perdão,',
    'não estou me sentindo muito bem. Curvou-se',
    'para frente e vomitou copiosamente no chão.',
    '- Tá melhor, assim, disse, tornando a',
    'endireitar-se, fechando os olhos., Nunca',
    'segurar a vontade, é o que eu digo. Soltar',
    'tudo enquanto está fresco no estômago.',
    'Retemperou-se, tornou a olhar para Winston',
    'e ímediatamente pareceu ter simpatizado',
    'com ele. Passou por seus ombros um braço',
    'enorme e puxou-o para perto, fungando cerveja',
    'e vômito na cara dele. Como é seu nome,',
    'queridinho? Smith. Smith? Engraçado! Meu',
    'nome também é Smith!, E acrescentou,',
    'sentimental:, Eu podia ser sua mãe! Podia,',
    'pensou Winston. Tinha mais ou menos a idade',
    'e o físico, e era provável que as pessoas',
    'mudassem muito em vinte e cinco anos de trabalhos',
    'forçados. Ninguém mais lhe falara. Surpreendentemente,',
    'os criminosos comuns nem tomavam conhecimento',
    'dos políticos, a quem chamavam de "politiqueiros,"',
    'com uma espécie de desprezo desinteressado.',
    'Os prisioneiros do Partido pareciam amedrontados',
    'demais para falar a quem quer que fosse,',
    'principalmente aos companheiros de infortúnio.',
    'Só uma vez, quando duas militantes foram',
    'apertadas de encontro ao banco é que ele',
    'entreouviu, em meio ao vozerio geral, umas',
    'palavras sussurradas à pressa; e em particular',
    'uma referência, que não compreendeu,',
    'à sala "um-zero-um". Havia talvez duas',
    'ou três horas que o tinham levado para',
    'ali. Não o largava a dor surda da barriga,',
    'que no entanto ora melhorava, ora piorava,',
    'e os seus pensamentos se expandiam ou contraíam.',
    'Quando piorava, só pensava na dor, e no',
    'seu desejo de comer. Quando melhorava, dominava-o',
    'um medo pânico. Havia momentos em que com',
    'tamanha clareza previa o que lhe ia acontecer,',
    'que o coração galopava e parava de respirar.',
    'Sentia o golpe dos bastões nos cotovelos',
    'e das botas ferradas nas canelas; via-se',
    'rojando no chão, pedindo misericórdia',
    'aos gritos, por entre os dentes partidos.',
    'Mal pensava em Júlia. Não podia fixar',
    'a mente em Júlia. Amava-a e não a trairia;',
    'mas era apenas um fato, sabido como as leis',
    'da matemática. Não sentia amor por ela,',
    'e quase não tinha vontade de saber o que',
    'lhe estava acontecendo. Com muito maior freqüência',
    'pensava em O\'Brien, com um raio de esperança.',
    'O\'Brien devia saber que ele fora preso. A',
    'Fraternidade, dissera ele, nunca procurava',
    'salvar seus membros. Mas havia a lâmina',
    'de barba; mandariam uma lâmina, se pudessem.',
    'Cinco segundos talvez se passassem antes',
    'dos guardas poderem levá-lo para a cela.',
    'A lâmina haveria de mordê-lo com uma',
    'espécie de frieza de queimar, e os dedos',
    'que a segurassem seriam lanhados até o',
    'osso. Tudo voltava ao corpo doente, que se',
    'encolhia, trêmulo, ante a menor dor. Não',
    'tinha certeza de usar lâmina, mesmo que',
    'tivesse tempo. Seria mais natural existir',
    'de momento a momento, aceitar mais dez minutos',
    'de vida mesmo com a certeza de mais tortura.',
    'às vezes, tentava calcular o número de',
    'tijolos de porcelana nas paredes da céla.',
    'Não seria difícil, porém sempre perdia',
    'a conta num ponto ou noutro. O mais das vezes',
    'perguntava a si mesmo onde estaria, e que',
    'horas seriam. Ora tinha a certeza de ser',
    'dia claro lá fora, ora sentia igual certeza',
    'de ser noite fechada. Sabia instintivamente',
    'que naquele lugar as luzes jamais apagariam.',
    'Era o lugar sem treva: agora via porque O\'Brien',
    'parecera reconhecer a alusão. No Ministério',
    'do Amor não havia janelas. Sua cela podia',
    'ser no meio do edifício, ou junto a uma',
    'parede externa; podia ser dez andares abaixo',
    'do solo, ou trinta acima. Deslocava-se mentalmente',
    'de um lugar para outro, tentando determinar',
    'sensoriamente se estava num andar alto ou',
    'enterrado num subsolo. De fora se ouviu o',
    'ruido de botas marchando. A porta de aço',
    'abriu-se com estrépito. Um jovem oficial,',
    'uma figura esbelta, de uniforme negro que',
    'brilhava nos couros polidos, e cujo rosto',
    'magro parecia uma máscara de cera, cruzou',
    'o limiar. Fez um gesto aos guardas, mandando',
    'que trouxessem o preso. O poeta Ampleforth',
    'foi atirado dentro da cela. A porta tornou',
    'a fechar-se com ruido. Ampleforth fez um',
    'ou dois movimentos incertos, de um lado para',
    'outro, como se imaginasse haver outra porta',
    'de saída; depois começou a vaguear pela',
    'cela. Ainda não percebera a presença',
    'de Winston. Seu olhar perturbado examinava',
    'a parede, a um metro acima da cabeça de',
    'Winston. Não tinha sapatos e os artelhos',
    'grandes e sujos escapavam pelos buracos das',
    'meias. Também fazia vários dias que não',
    'se barbeava. Uma barba rala cobria-lhe as',
    'faces, dando-lhe um ar de rufião que destoava',
    'do corpanzil balofo e dos seus movimentos',
    'nervosos. Winston sacudiu um pouco da sua',
    'letargia. Devia falar com Ampleforth, e arriscar-se',
    'a um grito da teletela. Era até concebível',
    'que Ampleforth lhe trouxesse a lâmina.',
    '- Ampleforth, chamou. Não houve berro',
    'da teletela. Ampleforth parou, um tanto assustado.',
    'Lentamente, focalizou os olhos em Winston.',
    '- Ah, Smith! Tu também?, Por que te prenderam?',
    '- Para te dizer a verdade. . ., sentou-se',
    'desajeitado no banco diante de Winston. -',
    'Só há um delito, não é?, E o cometeste?',
    '- Aparentemente. Levou a mão à testa',
    'e apertou as têmporas por um momento, como',
    'se tentasse recordar de algo., Essas coisas',
    'acontecem,, começou, vagamente., Consegui',
    'recordar um caso. um caso possível. Foi',
    'uma indiscrição, sem dúvida. Estávamos',
    'produzindo uma edição definitiva dos',
    'poemas de Kipling. Deixei que a palavra "Deus"',
    'ficasse no fim de um verso. Não pude evitá-lo!',
    '-acrescentou, quase indignado, levantando',
    'o olhar para Winston., Era impossível',
    'modificar o verso. A rima era "seus." Durante',
    'dias e dias quebrei a cabeça. Não havia',
    'outra rima possível. Modificou-se a expressão',
    'de seu rosto. Sumira-se o desgosto, e por',
    'um momento ele pareceu quase satisfeito.',
    'Uma espécie de calor intelectual, a alegria',
    'do pedante que descobriu um fato inútil,',
    'brilhava por entre os pelos sujos e crescidos.',
    '- Já te ocorreu que toda a história da',
    'poesia inglêsa foi determinada pelo fato',
    'de escassearem as rimas? Não, aquilo jamais',
    'ocorrera a Winston. E, na circunstância',
    'em que se encontrava, não lhe pareceu muito',
    'importante nem interessante., Sabes que',
    'horas são?, indagou. Ampleforth tornou',
    'a olhá-lo espantado., Nem pensei nisso.',
    'Prenderam-me. há uns dois ou três dias.',
    '- Seus olhos rodearam as paredes, como se',
    'esperasse encontrar uma janela nalguma parte.',
    '- Neste lugar não há diferença entre',
    'noite e dia. Não sei como se pode calcular',
    'o tempo. Conversaram sem propósito alguns',
    'minutos e então, sem razão aparente,',
    'um grito da teletela mandou que se calassem.',
    'Winston sentou-se quieto, braços cruzados.',
    'Ampleforth, muito grande para sentar-se cômodamente',
    'no banco estreito, a todo momento mudava',
    'de posição, segurando com as mãos ossudas',
    'ora um joelho ora outro. A teletela bradoulhe',
    'que ficasse quieto. Passou-se o tempo. Vinte',
    'minutos, uma hora, era difícil julgar.',
    'De novo se ouviu o barulho de botas lá',
    'fora. As entranhas de Winston se contraíram.',
    'Breve, muito breve, talvez dali a cinco minutos,',
    'talvez naquele instante, o barulho das botas',
    'traria a notícia de que chegara sua vez.',
    'A porta abriu-se. O oficial de cara fria',
    'entrou na cela. Com a mão indicou Ampleforth.',
    '- Sala 101, ordenou. Ampleforth saiu marchando',
    'desàjeitado entre os guardas, fisionomia',
    'vagamente perturbada, mas sem compreender.',
    'Passou-se um período que pareceu longo.',
    'Voltara a dor na barriga de Winston. Seu',
    'pensamento insistia em cair nos mesmos sulcos,',
    'como uma bola que repetidas vezes cai nos',
    'mesmos buracos. Tinha apenas seis idéias.',
    'A dor na barriga; um pedaço de pão; sangue',
    'e grito; O\'Brien; Júlia; a lâmina de',
    'barba. Houve novo espasmo nas entranhas.',
    'As botas ferradas aproximavam-se. Quando',
    'a porta se abriu, a corrente que fez trouxe',
    'uma onda de cheiro penetrante de suor frio.',
    'Parsons entrou na cela. Estava de shorts',
    'caqui e camisa esporte. Desta vez Winston',
    'ficou tão assombrado que esqueceu suas',
    'mazelas., Tu aqui!, exclamou. Parsons lançou',
    'a Winston um olhar em que não havía nem',
    'interêsse nem surpresa, mas apenas aflição.',
    'Pôs-se a andar nervoso para um lado e outro,',
    'evidentemente incapaz de ficar imóvel.',
    'Cada vez que endireitava os joelhos gorduchos',
    'via-se que tremiam. Tinha os olhos arregalados,',
    'como se não conseguisse desviar a vista',
    'de alguma coisa à distância., Por que',
    'te trouxeram?, perguntou Winston., Crimidéia!',
    '- respondeu Parsons, quase soluçando. O',
    'tom de sua voz implicava ao mesmo tempo completa',
    'admissão de culpa e uma espécie de horror',
    'incrédulo de que tal palavra pudesse aplicar-se',
    'a ele. Parou diante de Winston e pôs-se',
    'a apelar para ele, ansioso:, Achas que me',
    'fusilam, hein, velhinho? Não fusilam a',
    'gente que não fez nada mal, hein. só',
    'pensou, e quem segura o pensamento? Sei que',
    'fazem justiça. Oh, eu tenho confiança',
    'na justiça! Conhecem a minha ficha, não',
    'conhecem? Tu sabes quem eu era. Não era',
    'mau sujeito. Não tinha muita inteligência,',
    'mas tinha boa vontade. Fazia o que podia',
    'pelo Partido, não fazia? Será que me',
    'livro com cinco anos? Ou dez? Um sujeito',
    'como eu podia ser muito útil num campo',
    'de trabalhos. Achas que me fusilam por ter',
    'descarrilado uma vez só?, és culpado?',
    '- Naturalmente sou!, gritou Parsons, com',
    'uma olhadela servil à placa de metal. -',
    'Não crês que o Partido prenda inocentes?',
    '- A cara de rã acalmou-se um pouco, chegou',
    'a tomar uma expressão sentimonial., Crimidéia',
    'é uma coisa horrível, velho, afirmou,',
    'sentencioso., é insidiosa. Pode te pegar',
    'sem que te dês conta. Sabes como foi que',
    'me pegou? No sono. Sim, é fato. Lá estava',
    'eu, trabalhando duro, procurando fazer meu',
    'dever, sem nunca saber que tivesse nada de',
    '\'mau na cabeça. E daí comecei a falar',
    'dormindo. Sabes o que me ouviram dizendo?',
    'Baixou a voz, como alguém que se vê obrigado',
    'a pronunciar uma obscenidade, por ordem do',
    'médico ou do juiz., Abaixo o Grande Irmão!',
    'Sim, foi o que eu disse. E disse muitas vezes,',
    'ao que parece. Cá entre nós, meu velho,',
    'ainda bem que me pegaram antes que fosse',
    'além. Sabes o que vou dizer a eles quando',
    'comparecer no tribunal? "Obrigado," direi,',
    '"obrigado por me salvarem antes que fosse',
    'tarde demais.", Quem te denunciou?, perguntou',
    'Winston., Mnha filhinha, respondeu Parsons,',
    'com uma espécie de melancólico orgulho.',
    '- Escutou pelo buraco da fechadura. Ouviu',
    'o que eu disse e contou às patrulhas no',
    'dia seguinte. Sabidinha aquela guria de sete',
    'anos, hein? Não me queixo dela. Com efeito,',
    'tenho orgulho dela. Mostra, afinal, que lhe',
    'ensinei o que devia. Deu mais algumas passadas',
    'para um lado e outro, olhando várias vezes',
    'a privada, de soslaio. De repente, arriou',
    'os calções., Desculpe, velho. Não',
    'posso mais. é a espera. Pousou o volumoso',
    'trazeiro no vaso da privada. Winston cobriu',
    'o rosto com as mãos., Smith!, gritou',
    'a voz da teletela., 6079 Smith W! Descobre',
    'o rosto! Nada de esconder o rosto! Winston',
    'descobriu o rosto. Parsons usou o lavatório,',
    'ruidosa e abundantemente. Verificou-se depois',
    'que a descarga es \'tava defeituosa, e a cela',
    'fedeu abominàvelmente durante muitas horas.',
    'Parsons foi removido. Outros presos chegaram',
    'e partiram misteriosamente. Uma presa foi',
    'destinada à "Sala 101" e pareceu encolher-se',
    'e mudar de cor quando ouviu a ordem. Chegou',
    'um momento em que, se o tivessem levado ali',
    'de manhã, seria de tarde; se o tivessem',
    'levado de tarde seria meia- noite. Havia',
    'na cela seis presos, entre homens e mulheres.',
    'Todos sentados, calados e imóveis. Diante',
    'de Winston estava um homem sem queixo e sem',
    'dentes que parecia exatamente um grande roedor',
    'inofensivo. Suas bochechas gordas e flácidas',
    'pareciam guardar comida, e os olhos cinza',
    'pálido saltavam timidamente de rosto em',
    'rosto, fugindo à pressa quando encontravam',
    'os de outrem. A porta abriu-se e apareceu',
    'outro prisioneiro cujo aspecto deu um arrepio',
    'em Winston. Era um homem comum, de aparência',
    'medíocre, que poderia ser engenheiro ou',
    'técnico dalguma coisa. O que espantava.era',
    'a magreza do seu rosto. Parecia uma caveira.',
    'Por causa da magreza, a boca e os olhos tinham',
    'ficado desproporcionais, e os olhos pareciam',
    'cheios de ódio homicida, incontrolável,',
    'a\' alguém ou alguma coisa. O homem sentou-se',
    'no banco a pequena distância de Winston.',
    'Ele não tornou a olhá-lo, porém enxergava',
    'a cabeça atormentada, escaveirada, como',
    'se a tivesse diante de si. De repente descobriu',
    'do que se tratava. O homem estava morrendo',
    'de fome. A mesma idéia deve ter ocorrido',
    'quase simultaneamente a todos na cela. Houve',
    'um ligeiro movimento no banco inteiro. Os',
    'olhos do homem sem queixo pousavam a medo',
    'no escaveirádo e logo fugiam, como envergonhados;',
    'mas a atração \'era irresistível. Dali',
    'a pouco, começou a remexer-se no banco.',
    'Por fim levantou-se, atravessou a cela desajeitado,',
    'meteu a mão no bolso do macacão e, com',
    'ar émbaraçado, estendeu um pedaço de',
    'pão sujo ao homem-caveira. Houve um rugido',
    'furioso, ensurdecedor, da teletela. O sem',
    'queixo recuou num pulo. O homem-caveira escondera',
    'as mãos nas costas, como se a demonstrar',
    'ao mundo que recusava o presente., Bumstead!',
    'rugiu a voz., 2713 Bumstead J! Solta êsse',
    'pedaço de pão! O homem sem queixo derrubou',
    'o pão., Fica de pé onde estás, comandou',
    'a voz., Olha para a porta. Não te mexas.',
    'O homem obedeceu. As grandes bochechas flácidas',
    'tremiam sem controle. A porta abriu-se com',
    'estrépito. O jovem oficial entrou e afastou-se',
    'para o lado, dando passagem a um guarda baixo',
    'e atarracado,\'com enormes braços e ombros.',
    'Postou-se diante do homem e então, a um',
    'sinal do oficial, vibrou tremendo murro na',
    'boca sem queixo. A força foi tamanha que',
    'a vítima pareceu voar. O corpo foi lançado',
    'do outro lado da cela, chocando-se na base',
    'da privada. Por um momento, ali ficou, o',
    'sangue escuro escorrendo da boca e do nariz.',
    'Um gemido muito débil, que parecia inconsciente,',
    'se fez ouvir. Depois rolou e levantou-se',
    'hesitante, apoiando-se nas mãos e joelhos.',
    'Numa torrente de sangue e saliva, cairam-lhe',
    'da boca as duas metades da dentadura. Os',
    'presos deixaram-se ficar, imóveis, mãos',
    'postas nos joelhos. O homem sem queixo voltou',
    'para o seu lugar. De um lado, a carne do',
    'rosto estava escurecendo. A boca inchara,',
    'transformando-se numa massa informe, cor',
    'de cereja, com um orifício negro no meio.',
    'De vez em quando um pouco de sangue pingava',
    'no peito do macacão. Seus olhos cinzentos',
    'continuavam a saltar de face em face, mais',
    'culpados que nunca, como se tentasse descobrir',
    'até onde o desprezavam os outros, pela',
    'sua humilhação. A porta abriu-se. Com',
    'um pequeno gesto o oficial indicou o homem',
    'de cara de caveira., Sala 101. Ao lado de',
    'Winston houve uma exclamação e um movimento',
    'brusco. O homem atirara-se de joelhos ao',
    'chão, e erguia as mãos postas., Camarada!',
    'Oficial!, exclamou., Não tens que me',
    'levar para aquele lugar. Já não te disse',
    'tudo? Que mais queres saber? Confessei tudo,',
    'não sobrou nada. Dize-me o que queres que',
    'eu confesso. Escreve e eu assino. qualquer',
    'coisa! Mas não a sala 101!, Sala 101 -',
    'repetiu o oficial. A cara do homem, já',
    'muito pálido, ficou duma cor que Winston',
    'não acreditava possível. Era um tom verde,',
    'positivo, inconfundível., Faze comigo',
    'o que quiseres!, urrou., Há semanas que',
    'venho passando fome. Deixa-me morrer de fome.',
    'Fusila-me, enforca- me. Condena-me a vinte',
    'e cinco anos. Alguém mais que queres que',
    'eu denuncie? Dize o nome e eu confesso imediatamente.',
    'Não me importa quem seja, nem o que faças',
    'com ele. Tenho mulher e três filhos. O',
    'mais velho ainda não tem seis anos. Podes',
    'pegar todos eles e degolá-los na minha',
    'frente, que eu olho sem virar a cabeça.',
    'Mas a sala 101, não!, Sala 101. O homem,',
    'frenético, olhou em torno, examinando os',
    'outros presos, como se acreditasse poder',
    'oferecer outra vitima no seu lugar. Seus',
    'olhos pousaram na face ensanguentada do homem',
    'sem queixo. Estendeu o braço esquelético.',
    'é aquele que deves levar, e não eu! -',
    'gritou., Não ouviste o que ele disse depois',
    'que o esmurraram. Dá-me uma oportunidade',
    'e eu te contarei tudo, palavra por palavra.',
    'é ele que é contra o Partido, eu não!',
    '- Os guardas deram um passo à frente. A',
    'voz do homem elevou-se a um urro., Não',
    'ouviste o que ele disse!, repetiu., A teletela',
    'não estava funcionando direito. é ele',
    'que queres. Leva-o, não a mim! Os dois',
    'guardas robustos iam tomá-lo pelos braços,',
    'mas nesse momento exato ele se atirou ao',
    'chão da cela e agarrouse a uma das pernas',
    'de ferro que amparava o banco. Pôs-se a',
    'uivar, como um animal. Os guardas seguraram-no,',
    'para puxá-lo dali, mas ele resistiu com',
    'força espantosa. Durante uns vinte segundos,',
    'talvez, os dois atletas forcejaram. Os presos',
    'continuavam sentados, imóveis, olhando',
    'para frente. Os uivos pararam; o homem não',
    'tinha fôlego para outra coisa, além de',
    'segurar-se. Ouviu-se então um brado diferente.',
    'Um pontapé de um dos guardas partira-lhe',
    'os dedos da mão. Obrigaram-no a levantar-se.',
    '- Sala 101, repetiu o oficial. O homem foi',
    'levado embora, cambaleando, cabisbaixo e',
    'alisando a mão esmagada. Passou-se muito',
    'tempo. Se o homem caveira tivesse sido levado',
    'à meia-noite, era de manhã; se o fosse',
    'de manhã, era de tarde. Winston estava',
    'só, e assim tinha permanecido algumas horas.',
    'A dor de sentar-se no banco estreito era',
    'tanta que por fim ele se levantou e passeou',
    'um pouco, sem que a teletela o censurasse.',
    'O pedacinho de pão estava ainda onde o',
    'outro a derrubara. A princípio, foi preciso',
    'um grande esfôrço para não o olhar',
    'mas depois a fome deu lugar à sêde. Sentia',
    'um gosto ruim na boca pastosa. O zumbido',
    'constante e a luz branca tinham provocado',
    'uma espécie de fraqueza, uma sensação',
    'de vazio na cabeça. Levantava-se porque',
    'não podia mais agüentar a dor nos ossos,',
    'e então tornava a sentar-se, quase imediatamente,',
    'porque se sentia tonto demais para ficar',
    'de pé. O terror voltava sempre que conseguia',
    'controlar um pouco suas sensações físicas.',
    'às vezes, com diminuida esperança, pensava',
    'em O\'Brien e na lâmina de barba. Era imaginável',
    'que viesse escondida na comida, se é que',
    'lhe iam dar de comer. Pensou vagamente em',
    'Júlia. Devia estar sofrendo nalguma parte,',
    'talvez mais do que ele. Talvez estivesse',
    'gritando de dor, naquele instante. Imaginou:',
    '"Se eu pudesse salvar Júlia dobrando a',
    'minha dor, seria capaz? Sim, seria." Mas',
    'não passava de uma decisão intelectual,',
    'tomada por saber que devia tomá-la. Não',
    'a sentia. Naquele lugar não era possível',
    'sentir nada, exceto dor e presciência da',
    'dor. Além disso, era possível desejar,',
    'por qualquer motivo, que a dor aumentasse,',
    'quando já a sofria bastante? Era uma pergunta',
    'que ainda não podia responder. As botas',
    'fizeram-se ouvir de novo. A porta abriu-se.',
    'O\'Brien entrou. Winston levantou-se num pulo.',
    'O choque baniu todas suas precauções.',
    'Pela primeira vez, em muitos anos, esqueceu-se',
    'da presença da teletela., Também te',
    'pegaram!, exclamou., Pegaram-me há muito',
    'tempo, disse O\'Brien, com leve ironia, quase',
    'arrependida. Deu um passo para o lado e por',
    'trás dele apareceu um guarda- de peito',
    'largo, com um longo bastão negro na mão.',
    '- Sabias disto, disse O\'Brien., Não te',
    'iludas, Winston. Sabias. sempre soubeste.',
    'Sim, ele agora via que sempre o soubera.',
    'Mas não houve tempo para pensar. Só tinha',
    'olhos para o bastão do guarda. Podia cair',
    'em qualquer parte: no alto da cabeça, na',
    'ponta da orelha, no braço, no cotovelo.',
    'O cotovelo! Caira de joelhos, quase paralisado,',
    'protegendo com a mão o cotovelo atingido.',
    'Tudo explodira numa luz amarela. Inconcebível,',
    'inconcebível que um só golpe produzisse',
    'tamanha dor! O amarelo se foí e ele pôde',
    'enxergar os dois a contemplá-lo. O guarda',
    'ria-se das suas contorções. Ao menos',
    'uma dúvida fora esclarecida. Nunca, por',
    'nenhuma razão, se poderia desejar que a',
    'dor aumentasse. Da dor, só se podia desejar',
    'uma coisa, que parasse. Nada no mundo era',
    'tão horrível como a dor física. Em',
    'face da dor não há heróis, não há',
    'heróis, ele pensou e tornou a pensar, torcendo-se',
    'no chão, segurando à toa o braço esquerdo',
    'invalidado. 19 Estava deitado nalguma coisa',
    'que parecia uma cama de campanha, mais alta',
    'porém e sobre a qual estava fixado de maneira',
    'a não poder se mexer. Caía-lhe no rosto',
    'uma luz que parecia mais forte que a habitual.',
    'O\'Brien estava de pé junto dele, fitando-o',
    'atentamente. Do outro lado havia um homem',
    'de avental branco, segurando uma seringa',
    'de injeção. Mesmo depois de abrir os',
    'olhos só aos poucos foi compreendendo a',
    'forma das coisas. Tinha a impressão de',
    'ter chegado ali a nado, vindo de um mundo',
    'muito diferente, um distante mundo subaquático.',
    'Quanto tempo estaria ali, não sabia. Desde',
    'o momento da prisão não vira nem trevas',
    'nem a luz do dia. Além disso, sua memória',
    'não era contínua. Havia momentos em que',
    'a consciencia, mesmo a consciência que',
    'se tem durante o sono, se interrompera de',
    'todo, recomeçando depois de um intervalo',
    'em branco. E não havia meio de saber se',
    'êsses intervalos eram de dias, semanas',
    'ou apenas segundos. O pesadelo começara',
    'por aquele primeiro golpe no cotovelo. Mais',
    'tarde, verificaria que aquilo tudo não',
    'passava de preliminar, de interrogatório',
    'rotineiro, a que todos os presos eram submetidos.',
    'Havia uma longa série de crimes- espionagem,',
    'sabotagem, etcétera, que todo mundo devia',
    'confessar, por praxe. A confissão era uma',
    'formalidade, embora a tortura fosse real.',
    'Quantas vezes fora espancado, e durante quanto',
    'tempo, não conseguia se lembrar. Havia',
    'sempre cinco ou seis homens de uniforme negro',
    'ocupados com ele, simultaneamente. às vezes',
    'eram os punhos, outras os bastões, ou varas',
    'de aço, ou botas. Ocasiões havia em que',
    'rolava pelo chão, desavergonhadamente,',
    'como um animal, encolhendo o corpo daqui',
    'e dali, num esforço infindo, inútil,',
    'de fugir aos pontapés, e com isso apenas',
    'atraindo mais e mais coices, nas costelas,',
    'na barriga, nos cotovelos, nas canelas, nas',
    'vírilhas, nos testículos, no cócix.',
    'Havia ocasiões em que a pancadaria continuava',
    'longamente, até o cruel, perverso, imperdoável,',
    'não ser mais a brutalidade dos guardas,',
    'mas o fato de não poder perder os sentidos',
    'à vontade. Doutras, a coragem de tal modo',
    'lhe fugia que começava a implorar miserícórdia',
    'antes dos golpes começarem, e quando a',
    'simples vista de um punho fechado era suficiente',
    'para levá-lo a confessar um chorrilho de',
    'crimes reais e imaginários. Havia vezes',
    'em que começava com a decisão de nada',
    'confessar, em que cada palavra lhe tinha',
    'de ser arrancada entre gemidos de dor, e',
    'outras em que tentava débilmente resistir',
    'mais um pouco, dizendo: "Confessarei, mas',
    'ainda não. Devo agüentar até que a',
    'dor se torne insuportável. Mais três',
    'pontapés, mais dois, e então direi o',
    'que querem." Freqüentemente, era espancado',
    'até não poder mais se suster em pé,',
    'sendo então atirado como um saco de batatas',
    'ao chão de pedra duma cela; depois de recobrar-se',
    'algumas horas, levavam-no de novo e tornavam',
    'a bater-lhe. Havia também períodos mais',
    'longos de repouso. Lembrava-se vagamente',
    'deles, porque os passava dormindo ou numa',
    'espécie de estupor. Lembrava-se duma cela',
    'como uma cama de tábua, uma espécie de',
    'prateleira embutida na parede, uma bacia',
    'de folha, e refeições de sopa quente,',
    'pão e às vezes café. Lembrava-se de',
    'um barbeiro carrancudo que lhe cortou o cabelo',
    'e escanhoou o queixo, e homens antipáticos,',
    'muito ativos nos seus aventais brancos, a',
    'tomar-lhe o pulso, anotar-lhe os reflexos,',
    'revirar-lhe as pálpebras, apalpar-lhe o',
    'corpo todo à cata de fraturas, e a enterrar-lhe',
    'agulhas no braço para fazê-lo dormir.',
    'Os espancamentos diminuiram, e tornaram-se',
    'mais uma ameaça, um horror a que poderia',
    'ser recambiado a qualquer momento se suas',
    'respostas não satisfizessem. Agora, os',
    'inquisidores \'não eram os monstros de uniforme',
    'negro, mas intelectuais do Partido, homenzinhos',
    'rotundos de movimentos rápidos e óculos',
    'brilhantes, que se ocupavam dele em rodizio',
    'durante períodos que duravam, ele calculou,',
    'sem certeza, dez e doze horas, sem interrupção.',
    'êsses interrogadores providenciavam para',
    'ele que sentisse uma dor constante, embora',
    'ligeira; mas não era a dor a sua maior',
    'arma. Davam-lhe tapas na cara, torciam-lhe',
    'as orelhas, puxavam-lhe o cabelo, obrigavam-no',
    'a ficar de pé numa só perna, recusavam-se',
    'a dar licença para urinar, focavam lâmpadas',
    'fortes nos seus olhos, até lacrimejarem;',
    'porém o propósito disto tudo era apenas',
    'humilhá-lo e destruir-lhe o poder de raciocínio',
    'e argumentação. Sua verdadeira arma era',
    'o interrogatório impiedoso que continuava,',
    'hora após hora, arquitetando armadilhas,',
    'fazendo- o tropeçar aqui e ali, torcendo',
    'tudo quanto dissesse, condenando-o a cada',
    'passo pelas suas mentiras e contradições,',
    'até ele começar a chorar, tanto de vergonha',
    'como de fadiga nervosa. Freqüentemente,',
    'faziam-no chorar até meia-dúzia de vezes',
    'numa única sessão. A maior parte do tempo',
    'insultavam-no aos brados e, a cada hesitação,',
    'o ameaçavam de devolução aos guardas;',
    'havia também momentos em que de repente',
    'mudavam de tom, chamavam-no camarada, apelavam',
    'para ele em nome do Ingsoc e do Grande Irmão,',
    'e lhe perguntavam patèticamente se não',
    'tinha suficiente lealdade ao Partido para',
    'desejar desfazer o mal que fizera. Quando',
    'tinha os nervos em frangalhos, depois de',
    'horas e horas de interrogatório, até',
    'êsse apelo podia reduzi-lo a um chôro',
    'fungado. Por fim, as vozes insistentes o',
    'venciam mais completamente do que as botas',
    'e os punhos dos guardas. Tornou-se apenas',
    'uma boca que dizia, uma mão que assinava,',
    'tudo quanto lhe fosse exigido. Sua única',
    'preocupação era descobrir o que desejavam',
    'que confessasse e confessar depressa, antes',
    'que a tortura recomeçasse. Confessou o',
    'assassinio de eminentes membros do Partido,',
    'a distribuição de panfletos sediciosos,',
    'desfalque de fundos públicos, venda de',
    'segredos militares, sabotagem de todo gênero.',
    'Confessou ter sido espião a soldo do govêrno',
    'lestasiático desde 1968. Confessou-se crente',
    'religioso, admirador do capitalismo e pervertido',
    'sexual. Confessou haver assassinado a espôsa,',
    'embora soubesse, como certamente deviam saber',
    'também os interrogadores, que ela ainda',
    'vivia. Confessou ter-se mantido em contacto',
    'pessoal com Goldstein, havia muitos anos,',
    'e ter sido membro duma organização clandestina',
    'que incluía quase todos os seres humanos',
    'que jamais conhecera. Era mais fácil confessar',
    'tudo e implicar todos. Além disso, de certo',
    'modo, era tudo verdade. Era verdade que fora',
    'inimigo do Partido, e aos olhos do Partido',
    'não havia distinção entre o pensamento',
    'e o ato. Havia também recordações de',
    'outro gênero. Destacavam-se, desligadas,',
    'no seu espírito, como quadros rodeados',
    'de preto. Estava numa cela que tanto podia',
    'ser clara como escura, porque não enxergava',
    'mais que um par de olhos. Perto dele, um',
    'instrumento qualquer tiquetaqueava lentamente,',
    'com regularidade. Os olhos aumentavam de',
    'tamanho e luminosidade. De repente, ele se',
    'desprendeu donde estava, mergulhou nos olhos',
    'e foi engulido. Estava amarrado numa cadeira,',
    'cercado de mostradores, sob luzes ofuscantes.',
    'Um homem de branco consultava os mostradores.',
    'Lá fora ouviu-se o barulho de botas ferradas.',
    'A porta abriu-se com estrépito. O oficial',
    'de máscara de cera entrou, seguido por',
    'dois guardas. Sala 101, disse o oficial.',
    'O homem de avental branco não se voltou.',
    'Nem olhou para Winston; só lhe interessavam',
    'os mostradores. Estava rolando por um enorme',
    'corredor, de um quilômetro de extensão,',
    'inundado de gloriosa luz dourada, rindo às',
    'gargalhadas e gritando confissões a plenos',
    'pulmões. Confessava tudo, até mesmo o',
    'que conseguira prender durante a tortura.',
    'Estava contando toda a história da sua',
    'vida a um público que já a conhecia.',
    'Com ele estavam os guardas, os outros interrogadores,',
    'os homens de avental branco, O\'Brien, Júlia,',
    'o sr. Charrington, todos rolando juntos pelo',
    'corredor e gargalhando. Uma coisa horrível,',
    'que jazera no futuro, passara em branca nuvem',
    'e não acontecera. Estava tudo ótimo,',
    'não havia mais dor, e o último detalhe',
    'da sua vida se desnudou, compreendido, perdoado.',
    'Estava-se levantando da cama de tábua,',
    'na meia-certeza de ter ouvido a voz de O\'Brien.',
    'Durante todo o interrogatório, embora não',
    'o pudesse ver, tivera a impressão de ter',
    'O\'Brien ao lado. Era O\'Brien quem tudo dirigia.',
    'Mandara os guardas atacarem Winston e os',
    'impedira de o matarem. Era quem decidia quando',
    'Winston devia gritar de dor, quando devia',
    'se aliviar, quando comer, quando dormir,',
    'quando levar injeção no braço. Era',
    'quem fazia as perguntas e sugeria as respostas.',
    'Era o atormentador, o protetor, o inquisidor,',
    'o amigo. E uma vez, Winston não podia',
    'se lembrar se fora durante o sono natural,',
    'ou dopado, ou mesmo num momento de lucidez',
    '- uma voz murmurou no seu ouvido: "Não',
    'te preocupes, Winston; estás sob minha',
    'guarda. Há sete anos que te vigio. Agora',
    'chegou o grande momento. Eu te salvarei,',
    'eu te farei perfeito." Não estava seguro',
    'de que fosse a voz de O\'Brien. Mas era a',
    'mesma voz que lhe dissera "Tornaremos a nos',
    'encontrar onde não há treva," naquele',
    'outro sonho, sete anos atrás. Não se',
    'lembrava do fim do interrogatório. Houve',
    'um período de escuridão e depois a cela,',
    'ou sala, onde estava, materializou-se lentamente',
    'em torno dele. Estava deitado de costas,',
    'e impedido de mexer-se. Tinha o corpo preso',
    'em todos os \' pontos essenciais. Até a',
    'cabeça estava ligada. O\'Brien fitava-o',
    'com gravidade e alguma tristeza. Visto de',
    'baixo, seu rosto parecia tosco e gasto, olhos',
    'empapuçados, rugas cansadas do nariz ao',
    'queixo. Era mais velho do que Winston supusera;',
    'devia ter entre quarenta e oito e cinqüenta',
    'anos. Tinha na mão um mostrador com uma',
    'alavanca em cima e números em volta. -',
    'Eu te disse que se tornássemos a nos encontrar',
    'seria aqui. Sim. Sem qualquer aviso, além',
    'de um ligeiro movimento da mão de O\'Brien,',
    'uma onda de dor percorreu o corpo de Winston.',
    'Era uma dor assustadora, porque não podia',
    'ver o que acontecia, e tinha a sensação',
    'de que lhe infligiam um ferimento mortal.',
    'Não sabia se de fato estava acontecendo,',
    'ou se apenas o efeito era elètricamente',
    'provocado; mas sentia o corpo se deformando,',
    'as juntas dos ossos separadas, devagar. Embora',
    'a dor o fizesse suar na testa, o pior de',
    'tudo era o medo de que a espinha se rompesse.',
    'Trincou os dentes e respirou fundo, pelo',
    'nariz, procurando manter silêncio o mais',
    'possível., Estás com medo, disse O\'Brien,',
    'observando-lhe a face, de que algo arrebente,',
    'daqui a um momento. Teu medo é que seja',
    'a espinha. Tens uma nítida imagem mental',
    'das vértebras se separando e do líquido',
    'raquiano escorrendo. Não é nisso que',
    'pensas, Winston? Winston não respondeu.',
    'O\'Brien puxou a alavanca do mostrador. A',
    'onda de dor refluiu com a mesma rapidez com',
    'que viera. Quarenta, disse O\'Brien., Como',
    'vês, os números deste mostrador vão',
    'até cem. Lembra-te, durante toda nossa',
    'conversa, que está em meu poder infligir-te',
    'dor a qualquer momento, no grau que eu quiser.',
    'Se me mentires, ou tentares prevaricar de',
    'qualquer modo, ou caires em nível de ínteligência,',
    'gritarás de dor, instantâneamente. Compreendes?',
    '- Compreendo. Os modos de O\'Brien abrandaram-se.',
    'Arrumou os óculos, pensativo, e deu algumas',
    'passadas. Quando falou, foi com voz gentil',
    'e paciente. Tinha o ar de um médico, professor,',
    'ou sacerdote, ansioso de explicar e persuadir,',
    'e não de punir. Dou-me a esta trabalheira',
    'contigo, Winston, porque vales a pena. Sabes',
    'perfeitamente qual é o teu mal. E sabes',
    'há muitos anos, embora lutasses contra',
    'o conhecimento. és mentalmente desequilibrado.',
    'Sofres de memória defeituosa. és incapaz',
    'de recordar acontecimentos reais e pensas',
    'que te lembras de outros, que nunca tiveram',
    'lugar. Felizmente, é curável. Não te',
    'curaste, porque preferiste não te curar.',
    'Não te dispuseste a fazer um esforcinho.',
    'Neste mesmo instante, sei que te agarras',
    'à tua doença, sob a impressão de que',
    'é uma virtude. Consideremos um exemplo.',
    'Neste momento, com que potência a Oceania',
    'está em guerra?, Quando fui preso, a Oceania',
    'estava em guerra com a Lestásia., Com',
    'a Lestásia. Bom. E a Oceania sempre esteve',
    'em guerra com a Lestásia, não esteve?',
    'Winston respirou fundo. Abriu a boca para',
    'falar mas calou-se. Não podia tirar os',
    'olhos do mostrador., A verdade, Winston,',
    'por favor. Tua verdade. Dize-me o que pensas',
    'lembrar., Lembro-me de que há apenas uma',
    'semana antes de ser preso, não estávamos',
    'em guerra com a Lestásia. Era nossa aliada.',
    'A guerra era contra a Eurásia, e já durava',
    'havia quatro anos. Antes. O\'Brien deteve-o',
    'com um gesto., Outro exemplo,, disse ele.',
    '- Há alguns anos tiveste uma alucinação',
    'muito séria. Acreditavas que três homens,',
    'três antigos membros do Partido, de nomes',
    'Jones, Aaronson e Rutherford, executados',
    'por traição e sabotagem, após uma confissão',
    'integral, não tinham cometido os crimes',
    'imputados. Acreditavas ter visto prova documental',
    'inconfundível de que as confissões dos',
    'três eram falsas. Houve uma certa fotografia',
    'em torno da qual construiste uma alucinação.',
    'Acreditavas tê-la tomado nas mãos. A',
    'fotografia era mais ou menos assim. Um recorte',
    'retangular de jornal aparecera entre os dedos',
    'de O\'Brien. Durante cinco segundos talvez',
    'ficou ao alcance da visão de Winston. Era',
    'uma fotografia, e não havia dúvidas quanto',
    'à sua identidade. Era a fotografia. Era',
    'outro exemplar da foto de Jones, Aaronson',
    'e Rutherford numa função do Partido em',
    'Nova York, a mesma que por acaso tivera em',
    'mãos, onze anos atrás, e destruira quase',
    'imediatamente. Por um instante apenas teve-a',
    'diante dos olhos, depois tornou a sumir.',
    'Mas vira-a, não havia dúvida de que a',
    'vira! Fez um esforço desesperado, agoniado,',
    'de libertar o tórax e a cabeça. Era impossível',
    'mexer-se em qualquer direção, um centímetro',
    'que fosse. Por um momento, chegara a esquecer-se',
    'do mostrador. Tudo que queria era segurar',
    'de novo a fotografia, ou pelo menos vê-la.',
    '- Existe!, exclamou., Não,, disse O\'Brien.',
    'Atravessou a sala. Na parede oposta havia',
    'um buraco da memória. Ele levantou a grade.',
    'Sem que o vissem, o frágil pedaço de',
    'papel foi sugado pela corrente de ar quente;',
    'desapareceria numa labareda. O\'Brien voltou-se.',
    '- Cinza, disse., Nem mesmo cinza identificável.',
    'Pó. Não existe. Nunca existiu., Mas',
    'existiu! Existe! Existe na memória. Eu',
    'me lembro. Tu te lembras., Não me lembro',
    '- afirmou O\'Brien. O coração de Winston',
    'sossobrou. Era o duplipensar. Teve uma sensação',
    'mortal de impotência. Se ao menos pudesse',
    'ter certeza de que O\'Brien mentia, não',
    'teria tanta importância. Mas era perfeitamente',
    'possível que O\'Brien se tivesse esquecido',
    'da foto. E se assim fosse, já teria certamente',
    'esquecido sua negativa de se lembrar, e esquecido',
    'o esquecimento. Como era possível ter a',
    'certeza de que tudo não passava de estratagema?',
    'Esmagava-o o pensamento de que talvez pudesse',
    'de fato ocorrer aquele deslocamento lunàtico',
    'da mente. O\'Brien fitava-o com curiosidade',
    'nos olhos. Mais do que nunca tinha o ar dum',
    'mestre, dedicado a um aluno peralta mas promissor.',
    '- Há um ditado do Partido que se refere',
    'ao controle do passado, disse ele., Repete-o,',
    'por favor., "Quem controla o passado, controla',
    'o futuro; quem controla o presente controla',
    'o passado", repetiu Winston obediente. -',
    '"Quem controla o presente controla o passado,',
    '-disse O\'Brien sacudindo a cabeça devagar.',
    '- Na tua opinião, Winston, o passado tem',
    'existência real? De novo a sensação',
    'de impotência dominou Winston. Seus olhos',
    'contemplavam o mostrador. Não sabia qual',
    'a resposta salvadora; "sim", ou "não"?',
    'Nem ao menos sabia que resposta acreditava',
    'verdadeira. O\'Brien sorriu levemente., Não',
    'és metafísico, Winston. Até êste',
    'momento, não havias considerado o que significa',
    'existência. Farei uma frase mais precisa.',
    'O passado existe concretamente, no espaço?',
    'Existe em alguma parte um mundo de objetos',
    'sólidos, onde o passado ainda acontece?',
    '- Não., Então onde é que existe o',
    'passado, se é que existe?, Nos registros.',
    'Está escrito., Nos registros. E em-que',
    'mais?, Na memória. Na memória dos homens.',
    '- Na memória. Muito bem. Nós, o Partido,',
    'controlamos todos os registros, e controlamos',
    'todas as memórias, Nesse caso controlamos',
    'passado, não é verdade?, Mas como podes',
    'impedir que a gente se lembre das coisas?',
    '- exclamou Winston, de novo se esquecendo',
    'do mostrador., é involuntário. . Está',
    'fora do indivíduo. Como podes controlar',
    'a memória? Não controlaste a minha! Os',
    'modos de O\'Brien tornaram-se rispidos de',
    'novo. Poúsou a mão no mostrador., Ao',
    'contrário, disse ele., Foste tu que não',
    'a controlaste. Por isso estás aqui. Estás',
    'aqui porque fracassaste em humildade, em',
    'disciplina. Não queres fazer o ato de submissão',
    'que é o preço da sanidade. Preferiste',
    'ser lunático, minoria de um. Só a mente',
    'disciplinada pode enxergar a realidade, Winston.',
    'Crês que a realidade é algo objetivo,',
    'externo, que existe de per si. Acreditas',
    'também que é evidente a natureza da realidade.',
    'Quando te iludes, e pensas enxergar algo,',
    'julgas que todo mundo vê a mesma coisa.',
    'Mas eu te digo, Winston, a realidade não',
    'é externa. A realidade só existe no espírito,',
    'e em nenhuma outra parte. Não na mente',
    'do indivíduo, que pode se enganar, e que',
    'logo perece. Só na mente do Partido, que',
    'é coletivo e imortal. O que quer que o',
    'Partido afirme que é verdade é verdade.',
    'é impossível ver a realidade exceto pelos',
    'olhos do Partido. é êsse o fato que deves',
    'reaprender, Winston. Exige um ato de auto-destruição,',
    'um esforço da vontade. Deves te humilhar',
    'antes de recobrar o juizo. Fez uma pausa',
    'de alguns momentos, como se para permitir',
    'que suas palavras calassem fundo., Lembras-te',
    'de escrevér no teu diário: "liberdade',
    'é a liberdade de escrever que dois e dois',
    'são quatro?", Lembro. O\'Brien mostrou',
    'a mão esquerda, de dorso para Winston,',
    'com o polegar oculto e mostrando quatro dedos.',
    '- Quantos dedos tenho aqui, Winston?, Quatro.',
    '- E se o Partido disser que não são quatro,',
    'mas cinco. quantos?, Quatro. A palavra',
    'acabou numa exclamação de dor. O ponteiro',
    'do mostrador fora até cinqüenta e cinco.',
    'O suor brotara em todo o corpo de Winston.',
    'O ar rasgava-lhe os pulmões e saia de novo',
    'em profundos gemidos que nem mesmo trincando',
    'os dentes ele conseguia calar. O\'Brien observava-o,',
    'com os quatro dedos ainda estendidos. Puxou',
    'a alavanca. Desta vez a dor apenas diminuiu',
    'um pouco., Quantos dedos, Winston?, Quatro.',
    'O ponteiro subiu a sessenta., Quantos dedos,',
    'Winston?, Quatro! Quatro! Não posso dizer',
    'outra coisa! Quatro! O ponteiro deve ter-se',
    'adiantado mais, porém ele não olhou.',
    'O rosto largo e severo, e os quatro dedos,',
    'tomavam-lhe toda a visão. Os dedos estavam',
    'na sua frente como colunas, enormes, e pareciam',
    'vibrar, mas não havia dúvida de que eram',
    'quatro., Quantos dedos, Winston?, Quatro!',
    'Pára, pára! Como podes continuar? Quatro!',
    'Quatro!, Quantos dedos, Winston?, Cinco!',
    'Cinco! Cinco!, Não, Winston. Assim não',
    'adianta. Estás mentindo. Ainda achas que',
    'são quatro. Quantos dedos, por favor? -',
    'Quatro! Cinco! Quatro! O que quiseres. Mas',
    'pára, pára a dor! Abruptamente, achou-se',
    'sentado na cama, com o braço de O\'Brien',
    'passado por seus ombros. Talvez tivesse perdido',
    'os sentidos por alguns segundos. Tinham-se',
    'afrouxado os laços que amarravam o seu',
    'corpo. Sentia muito frio, e tremia descontroladamente.',
    'Os dentes chocalhavam, e as lágrimas\'rolavam',
    'pelas faces. Por um momento, agarrou-se a',
    'O\'Brien como um nenê, curiosamente consolado',
    'pelo braço musculoso passado por seus ombros.',
    'Tinha a impressão de ser O\'Brien seu protetor,',
    'de que a dor era algo que vinha de fora,',
    'de outra fonte, e que O\'Brien o salvava dela.',
    '- Aprendes devagar, Winston, disse O\'Brien,',
    'gentilmente., Que Posso fazer?, choramingou.',
    '- Como posso deixar de ver o que está diante',
    'dos meus olhos? Dois e dois são quatro.',
    '- às vezes, Winston. às vezes são cinco.',
    'às vezes são três. As vezes são as',
    'três coisas ao mesmo tempo. Deves fazer',
    'maior esforço. Não é fácil recobrar',
    'a razão. Tornou a deitar Winston na cama.',
    'Apertou-se de novo a prisão nos membros,',
    'porém a dor se fora e o tremor parara,',
    'deixando- o apenas fraco e com frio. O\'Brien',
    'fez um movimento com a cabeça, dirigindo-se',
    'ao homem do avental branco, que durante toda',
    'a cena estivera imóvel. O homem inclinou-se',
    'e examinou de perto os olhos de Winston,',
    'tateoulhe o pulso, encostou-lhe a orelha',
    'ao peito, deu tapinhas ali e aqui; depois',
    'sacudiu a cabeça positivamente., Outra',
    'vez, disse O\'Brien. A dor percorreu o corpo',
    'de Winston. A agulha devia ter atingido setenta,',
    'ou setenta e cinco. Desta vez ele fechara',
    'os olhos. Sabia que os dedos ainda estavam',
    'ali e que ainda eram quatro. A única coisa',
    'que importava era continuar vivo até passar',
    'o espasmo. Deixou de perceber se chorava',
    'ou não. A dor tornou a diminuir. Ele abriu',
    'os olhos. O\'Brien puxara a alavanca., Quantos',
    'dedos, Winston?, Quatro. Imagino que sejam',
    'quatro. Veria cinco, se pudesse. Estou tentando',
    'ver cinco., Que desejas? Convencer-me de',
    'que vês cinco, ou de fato vê- los? -',
    'Vê-los de fato., Outra vez. O ponteiro',
    'devia ter ido a oitenta. .. noventa talvez.',
    'Winston só intermitentemente podia se lembrar',
    'porque a dor acontecia. Atrás das pálpebras',
    'cerradas, uma floresta de dedos parecia movimentar-se',
    'numa espécie de dança, entrando e saindo,',
    'desaparecendo atrás dos outros e tornando',
    'a aparecer. Tentava contá-los, mas não',
    'se lembrava porque. Só sabia ser impossível',
    'contá-los, e que isto se devia à misteriosa',
    'identidade entre o quatro e o cinco. A dor',
    'diminuiu de novo. Quando abriu os olhos foi',
    'verificar que ainda via o mesmo. Inúmeros',
    'dedos, como árvores movediças, corriam',
    'em todas as direções, cruzando e recruzando',
    'seu campo de visão. Tornou a fechar os',
    'olhos., Quantos dedos estou mostrando, Winston?',
    '- Não sei. Não sei. Me matas, se me deres',
    'dor outra vez. Cinco, quatro, seis. sinceramente,',
    'não sei. Está melhor. Uma agulha penetrou',
    'o braço de Winston. Quase no mesmo instante,',
    'um delicioso calor balsâmico se espalhou',
    'por todo o seu corpo. A dor já estava meio-esquecida.',
    'Abriu os olhos e fitou O\'Brien com gratidão.',
    'O coração pareceu virar, à vista daquele',
    'rosto grande e enrugado, tão feio e tão',
    'inteligente. Se pudesse mexer-se, teria esticado',
    'a mão e segurado o braço de O\'Brien.',
    'Nunca o estimara tão profundamente como',
    'naquele momento, e não apenas por ter parado',
    'a dor. Voltara a velha sensação, de que',
    'no fundo não tinha importância que O\'Brien',
    'fosse amigo ou inimigo. Era uma pessoa com',
    'quem se podia conversar. Talvez não quisesse',
    'ser tão estimado quanto compreendido. O\'Brien',
    'o torturara, levara-o à beira da loucura',
    'e, dentro em breve, certamente o mandaria',
    'à morte. Não fazia diferença. Num sentido',
    'qualquer, que ia mais fundo que a amizade,',
    'eram íntimos; nalguma parte, embora as',
    'palavras jamais fossem ditas, havia um lugar',
    'onde poderiam encontrar-se e falar. O\'Brien',
    'fitava-o com uma expressão que levava a',
    'suspeitar que pensasse o mesmo. Quando falou,',
    'foi num tom fácil, de palestra., Sabes',
    'onde estás, Winston?, Não sei. Mas adivinho.',
    'No Ministério do Amor., Sabes há quanto',
    'tempo estás aqui?, Não sei. Dias, semanas,',
    'meses. .. creio que há meses., E por que',
    'imaginas que trazemos gente aqui?, Para',
    'obrigá-la \'a confessar., Não, a razão',
    'não é essa. Tenta outra., Para puni-la.',
    '- Não!, exclamou O\'Brien, cuja voz mudara',
    'extraordinàriamente. Sua face se tornara',
    'ao mesmo tempo severa e animada., Não!',
    'Não apenas para te extrair uma confissão,',
    'nem para te punir. Queres que diga porque',
    'foste trazido aqui? Para te curar! Para te',
    'salvar da loucura! Compreenderás, Winston,',
    'que ninguém, dos que trazemos a êste',
    'lugar, sai de nossas mãos sem estar curado?',
    'Não estamos interessados nos estúpidos',
    'crimes que cometeste. O Partido não se',
    'interessa pelo ato físico; é com os pensamentos',
    'que nos preocupamos. Não apenas destruimos',
    'nossos inimigos; nós os modificamos. Compreendes',
    'o que quero dizer? Estava inclinado sobre',
    'Winston. Seu rosto parecia enorme por causa',
    'da proximidade, e horrivelmente feio por',
    'ser visto de baixo. Além disso, estava',
    'cheio de uma espécie de exaltação,',
    'de lunática intensidade. O coração',
    'de Winston tornou a apequenar-se no peito.',
    'Se fosse possível, ele se enterraria mais',
    'na cama. Tinha\'a certeza de que o outro estava',
    'a ponto de acionar a alavanca, por pura perversidade.',
    'Nesse momento, porém, O\'Brien se voltou.',
    'Pôs-se a passear de um lado para outro.',
    'Depois continuou, com menos veemencia: -',
    'A primeira coisa que deves entender é que',
    'neste lugar não há martírios. Lêste',
    'a história das perseguições religiosas',
    'na Idade Média, quando havia a inquisição.',
    'Foi um fracasso. Tinha por intúito erradicar',
    'a heresia, e por fim só conseguiu perpetuá-la.',
    'Para cada hereje queimado na fogueira, surgiram',
    'milhares de outros. Por que? Porque a inquisição',
    'matava os inimigos abertamente, e os matava',
    'quando ainda não se haviam arrependido;',
    'com efeito, matava-os porque não se arrependiam.',
    'Os homens morriam por se recusarem a abandonar',
    'as suas verdadeiras crenças. Naturalmente,',
    'tôda a glória pertencia à vítima',
    'e a vergonha ao Inquisidor que a queimava.',
    'Mais tarde, no século vinte, houve os chamados',
    'totalitários. Os nazistas alemães, e',
    'os comunistas russos. Os russos perseguiram',
    'a heresia mais cruelmente que a inquisição.',
    'Imaginavam ter aprendido com os erros do',
    'passado; sabiam, ao menos, que era preciso',
    'não fazer mártires., Antes de exporem',
    'suas vítimas ao julgamento público, procuravam',
    'destruir-lhes deliberadamente a dignidade.',
    'Abatiam-nos pela tortura e a solidão, até',
    'se transformarem em desprezíveis réprobos,',
    'confessando o que lhes fosse posto na boca,',
    'cobrindo-se de infâmia, acusando-se e abrígando-se',
    'atrás dos outros, choramingando misericórdia.',
    'E no entanto, apenas alguns anos mais tarde,',
    'a mesma coisa acontecia de novo. Os mortos',
    'se haviam transformado em mártires, e fora',
    'esquecida sua degradação. Máis uma',
    'vez, por que? Em primeiro lugar, porque as',
    'confissões que haviam feito eram óbviamente',
    'extorquidas e falsas. Nós não cometemos',
    'erros dêsse gênero. Tôdas as confissões',
    'feitas aqui são verdadeiras. Nós as tornamos',
    'verdadeiras. E, acima de tudo, não permitimos',
    'que os mortos se levantem contra nós. Deves',
    'deixar de pensar que a posteridade te vindicará,',
    'Winston. A posteridade jamais ouvirá falar',
    'de ti. Serás totalmente eliminado da história.',
    'Havemos de te transformar em gás e te soltar',
    'na estratosfera. Nada restará de ti: nem',
    'um nome num registro, nenhuma lembrança',
    'na mente. Serás aniquilado no passado como',
    'no futuro. Não terás existido nunca.',
    'Então por que se dar ao trabalho de me',
    'torturar? pensou Winston, num momento de',
    'amargura. O\'Brien deteve-se em meio a um',
    'passo, como se Winston tivesse pensado alto.',
    'A carantonha aproximou-se, olhos apertados.',
    '- Estás pensando: já que pretendemos',
    'te destruir tão completamente, de maneira',
    'que não faça a mínima diferença o',
    'que disseres ou fizeres,, nesse caso, porque',
    'nos damos ao trabalho de primeiro te interrogar,',
    'não é? Foi o que pensaste, não foi?',
    'Foi, admitiu Winston. O\'Brien sorriu ligeiramente.',
    '- és uma falha na urdidura, Winston. és',
    'uma nódoa que precisa ser limpa. Não',
    'acabo de te dizer que somos diferentes dos',
    'promotores do passado? Não nos contentamos',
    'com a obediência negativa, nem mesmo com',
    'a mais abjeta submissão. Quando finalmente',
    'te renderes a nós, deverá ser por tua',
    'livre e espontânea vontade. Não destruimos',
    'o hereje porque nos resista; enquanto nos',
    'resiste, nunca o destruimos. Convertemo-lo,',
    'capturamos-lhe a mente, damoslhe nova forma.',
    'Nele queimamos todo o mal e toda alucinação;',
    'trazemo-lo para o nosso lado, não em aparência,',
    'mas genuinamente, de corpo e alma. Tornamo-lo',
    'um dos nossos antes de matá-lo. é-nos',
    'intolerável que exista no mundo um pensamento',
    'errôneo, por mais secreto e inerme que',
    'seja. Nem mesmo no instante da morte podemos',
    'admitir um desvio. No passado, o hereje caminhava',
    'para a fogueira ainda herético, proclamando',
    'sua heresia, nela se gloriando. Até a vítima',
    'dos expurgos russos conseguia levar a rebelião',
    'selada no crânio, enquanto ia pelo corredor',
    'à espera do tiro. Mas nós tornamos perfeito',
    'o cérebro do individuo antes de matá-lo.',
    'A ordem dos antigos despotismos era "tu não',
    'farás." Os totalitários -mudaram para',
    '"tu farás". Nossa ordem é "tu és."',
    'Ninguém, dos que trazemos a êste lugar,',
    'se volta contra nós. Todo mundo é levado.',
    'Até mesmo aqueles miseráveis traidores,',
    'em cuja inocência um dia acreditastes -',
    'Jone, Aaronson e Rutherford, por fim cederam.',
    'Eu mesmo tomei parte no interrogatório.',
    'E os vi se entregando aos poucos, gemendo,',
    'choramingando, rojando ao chão. e no',
    'fim não era de dor ou medo, mas de pura',
    'penitência. Quando acabamos com eles,',
    'eram apenas invólucros de homens. Neles',
    'nada restava, além da mágua pelo que',
    'haviam cometido, e amor ao Grande Irmão.',
    'Era tocante ver como o amavam. Imploravam',
    'o fusilamento sem espera, para que pudessem',
    'morrer enquanto tinham ainda o pensamento',
    'limpo. Sua voz tornara-se quase sonhadora.',
    'A exaltação, o entusiasmo lunático,',
    'ainda estavam no seu rosto. Não está',
    'fingindo, pensou Winston. Não é hipócrita:',
    'acredita em tudo que diz. O que mais o oprimia',
    'era ter consciência da sua própria inferioridade',
    'inteletual. Observou o corpanzil, forte mas',
    'gracioso, deslocar-se de um lado para outro,',
    'fugindo ao seu campo de visão. De todas',
    'as maneiras, O\'Brien era maior do que ele.',
    'Não havia idéia que tivesse, ou pudesse',
    'ter tido, que O\'Brien, muito antes, já',
    'não tivesse conhecido, examinado e repelido.',
    'Sua mente continha a mente de Winston. Mas',
    'nesse caso, como poderia ser que fosse louco?',
    'O louco devia ser ele, Winston. O\'Brien parou',
    'e tornou a olhar para ele. A voz de novo',
    'adquirira um tom ríspido:, Não imagines',
    'que te salvarás, Winston, por mais completamente',
    'que te rendas. Quem se desvia uma vez não',
    'é nunca poupado. E mesmo que resolvamos',
    'permitir que vivas até o fim normal da',
    'tua vida, não nos escaparás. O que acontece',
    'aquí dura para sempre. Compreende isso,',
    'antecipadamente. Havemos de te esmagar até',
    'o ponto de onde não se volta. Vão te',
    'acontecer coisas das quais não poderias',
    'te recuperar nem que vivesses mil anos. Nunca',
    'mais poderás sentir sensações humanas',
    'comuns. Tudo estará morto dentro de ti.',
    'Nunca mais serás capaz de amor, ou amizade,',
    'ou alegria de viver, riso, curiosidade, coragem,',
    'ou integridade. Serás oco. Havemos de te',
    'expremer, te deixar vazio, e então saberemos',
    'como te encher. Fez uma pausa e indicou qualquer',
    'coisa ao homem do avental branco. Winston',
    'percebeu que algum aparelho pesado estava',
    'sendo colocado debaixo da sua cabeça. O\'Brien',
    'sentou- se ao lado da cama, de modo a ficar',
    'com a cabeça quase no nível de Winston.',
    '- Três mil, disse ele, dirigindo-se ao',
    'homem de branco. Duas almofadinhas, que pareciam',
    'um tanto úmidas, foram aplicadas às fontes',
    'de Winston. Ele desacorçoou. Ia sentir',
    'dor, uma nova espécie de dor. O\'Brien pousou',
    'a mão sobre a dele, num gesto tranquilizador,',
    'quase bondoso., Desta vez não dói -',
    'afirmou., Fixa-me bem nos olhos. Naquele',
    'momento houve uma tremenda explosão, ou',
    'o que parecia uma formidável explosão,',
    'embora Winston não tivesse certeza de ouvir',
    'barulho algum. Sem dúvida, porém, houvera',
    'um clarão ofuscante. Winston não se sentiu',
    'dorido, apenas prostrado. Embora já estivesse',
    'deitado de costas quando sucedeu a coisa,',
    'teve a curiosa sensação de que fora a',
    'explosão que o jogara assim. Um golpe terrível,',
    'sem dor, lançara-o abaixo. Dentro da sua',
    'cabeça, também acontecera algo. Quando',
    'seus olhos recobraram o foco, ele se lembrou',
    'quem era, onde estava, e reconheceu o rosto',
    'que o fitava de perto; mas nalgum lugar havia',
    'uma vasta área de vazio, como se lhe tivessem',
    'tirado um pedaço do miolo., Não dura',
    'muito, disse O\'Brien., Fita-me nos olhos.',
    'Com que país a Oceania está em guerra?',
    'Winston pensou. Sabia o que queria dizer',
    'Oceania, e que era cidadão da Oceania.',
    'Lembrava-se também da Lestásia e da Eurásia;',
    'mas não sabia quem estava em guerra. Com',
    'efeito, não tinha ciência de nenhuma',
    'guerra., Não me lembro., A Oceania está',
    'em guerra com a Lestásia. Lembras disso?',
    '- Lembro., A Oceania sempre esteve em guerra',
    'com a Lestásia. Desde o comêço da tua',
    'vida, desde o comêço do Partido, desde',
    'o comêço da história, a guerra continua',
    'sem interrupção, sempre a mesma guerra.',
    'Lembras disso?, Lembro., Há onze anos,',
    'criaste uma lenda em tôrno de três homens',
    'que foram condenados à morte por traição.',
    'Pretendias ter visto um pedaço de papel',
    'que os provava inocentes. êsse pedaço',
    'de papel nunca existiu. Tu o inventaste,',
    'e mais tarde vieste a acreditar nele. Lembras',
    'agora o momento exato em que o inventaste?',
    '- Lembro., Mostrei os dedos de minha mão.',
    'Viste cinco dedos. Lembras disso? Lembro.',
    'O\'Brien levantou os dedos da mão esquerda,',
    'escondendo o polegar. Aqui há cinco dedos.',
    'Vês cinco dedos? Vejo. E viu mesmo, por',
    'um instante fugidio, antes de mudar a cena,',
    'no seu espírito. Viu cinco dedos, sem deformidade.',
    'Depois tudo voltou ao normal, e o velho medo,',
    'o ódio e o espanto regressaram de tropel.',
    'Mas um momento houvera, não se lembrava',
    'da súa duração, trinta segundos, talvez',
    '- de certeza luminosa, em que cada nova sugestão',
    'de O\'Brien enchera uma área de vazio e',
    'se transformara em verdade absoluta, e durante',
    'o qual dois e dois podiam perfeitamente ser',
    'cinco, se fosse necessário. Desvanecera-se',
    'antes de O\'Brien ter baixado a mão. Embora',
    'não pudesse recapturá-llo, podia recordá-lo,',
    'como quem recorda uma vívida experiência',
    'num período remoto da vida, em que se foi,',
    'na verdade, uma pessoa diferente., Agora',
    'percebes que é possível, disse O\'Brien.',
    '- Sím. O\'Brien ergueu-se com ar satisfeito.',
    'à sua esquerda, Winston viu o homem de',
    'branco quebrar o pescoço duma ampola e',
    'puxar o êmbolo duma seringa hipodérmica.',
    'O\'Brien voltou-se para Winston com úm sorriso.',
    'Com o gesto familiar, rearranjou os óculos',
    'no nariz., Lembras-te de ter escrito no',
    'teu diário que não importava que eu fosse',
    'amigo ou inimigo, pois era ao menos uma pessoa',
    'que te compreendia e com quem se podia conversar?',
    'Tinhas razão. Gosto de conversar contigo.',
    'Tua mente me atrai. Parece-se com a minha,',
    'com a diferença -de que és louco. Antes',
    'de encerrarmos a sessão, podes me fazer',
    'algumas perguntas, se quiseres., Qualquer',
    'Pergunta?, Qualquer., Viu que os olhos',
    'de Winston estavam -no mostrador., Está',
    'desligado. Qual é a tua primeira pergunta?',
    '- Que foi feito de Júlia? O\'Brien tornou',
    'a sorrir., Ela te traiu, Winston. Imediatamente.',
    'sem reservas. Raramente tenho visto uma pessoa',
    'vir a nós tão depressa. Mal a reconhecerias,',
    'se a visses. Tôda sua rebeldia, seu fingimento,',
    'sua loucura, sua sujeira mental, tudo foi',
    'queimado. Foi uma conversão perfeita, um',
    'caso de cartilha., Tu a torturaste. O\'Brien',
    'não respondeu. Outra -pergunta., Existe',
    'o Grande Irmão?, Naturalmente existe.',
    'O Partido existe. O Grande Irmão é a',
    'corporificação do Partido. Mas existe',
    'da mesma maneira que eu existo? Tu não',
    'existes. De novo a sensação de impotência',
    'o assaltou. Sabia, ou podia imaginar, os',
    'argumentos que provavam sua não-existência;',
    'mas eram insensatos, não passavam de jôgo',
    'de palavras. Não continha a afirmativa',
    '"Tu não existes" um absurdo em lógica?',
    'Mas de que adiantava dizê-lo? Sua mente',
    'encolhia-se só de pensar nos argumentos',
    'loucos, irrespondíveis, com que O\'Brien',
    'o demoliria., Creio que existo, respondeu.',
    '- Tenho consciencia de minha própria identidade.',
    'Nasci, e morrerei. Tenho braços e pernas.',
    'Ocupo um determinado ponto no espaço. Ao',
    'mesmo tempo, outro sólido pode ocupar o',
    'mesmo ponto. Nesse sentido, o Grande Irmão?',
    '- Não tem importância. Existe. nenhum',
    'existe, O Grande Irmão morrerá?, Lógico',
    'que não. Como poderia morrer? Outra pergunta.',
    '- Existe a Fraternidade?, Isso nunca saberás,',
    'Winston. Se resolvermos te pôr em liberdade',
    'quando acabarmos a tarefa, e mesmo que vivas',
    'até os noventa, nunca saberás se a resposta',
    'a essa pergunta é Sim ou Não. Enquanto',
    'viveres será um enigma insolvível na',
    'tua cabeça. Winston guardou silêncio.',
    'Seu peito ofegou um pouco mais depressa.',
    'Ainda não fizera a pergunta que lhe viera',
    'em primeiro lugar à mente. Tinha de fazê-la,',
    'e no entanto era como se a língua se recusasse.',
    'Havia uma sombra de jocosidade no rosto de',
    'O\'Brien. Até os seus óculos pareciam',
    'despedir lampejos irônicos. Ele sabe, pensou',
    'Winston de repente, ele sabe o que vou perguntar!',
    'E a isso as palavras lhe brotaram dos lábios:',
    '- O que é a Sala 101? Não mudou a expressão',
    'do rosto de O\'Brien. Respondeu secamente:',
    '- Sabes o que há na Sala 101, Winston.',
    'Todo mundo sabe o que há na Sala 101. Apontou',
    'com o dedo o homem de branco. Evidentemente.,',
    'encerrara-se a sessão. A agulha mergulhou',
    'no braço de Winston. Quase imediatamente',
    'ele mergulhou no sono profundo. 20, Há',
    'três estágios na tua re-integração',
    '- disse O\'Brien., Aprender, compreender',
    'e aceitar. é hora de iniciares o segundo.',
    'Como sempre, Winston jazia em decúbito',
    'dorsal. Mas já não se sentia tão fortemente',
    'ligado. Ainda estava amarrado à cama, porém',
    'podia mexer um pouco os joelhos, mover a',
    'cabeça de um lado para outro e levantar',
    'os braços, dobrando os cotovelos. O mostrador,',
    'também, já não o aterrorizava tanto.',
    'Podia fugir às suas picadas se fosse bastante',
    'alerta: em geral era quando demonstrava estupidez',
    'que O\'Brien acionava a alavanca. às vezes,',
    'atravessavam uma sessão inteira sem que',
    'o aparelho fosse usado. Não podia lembrar-se',
    'de quantas sessões sofrera. Todo o processo',
    'parecia prolongar-se por um período enorme,',
    'indefinido, semanas, possívelmente, e',
    'o intervalo entre as sessões às vezes',
    'era de alguns dias, outras de apenas uma',
    'hora ou duas., Enquanto estás aí deitado',
    '- disse O\'Brien, muitas vezes perguntas',
    'a ti mesmo. e até a mim. por que é',
    'que o Ministério do Amor gasta tanto tempo',
    'e tanto esfôrço contigo. E quando eras',
    'livre também te admirava essencialmente',
    'a mesma pergunta. Podias perceber a mecânica',
    'da sociedade em que vivias, mas não os',
    'motivos orientadores. Lembras-te de que escreveste',
    'no teu diário "Compreendo como; não compreendo',
    'por que?" Era quando pensavas no por que"',
    'que duvidavas do teu estado mental. Leste',
    'o livro, o livro de Goldstein, ou trechos',
    'dele, pelo menos. Reveloute alguma coisa',
    'que já não soubesses?, Leste o livro?',
    '- Eu oescrevi. Isto é, colaborei na sua',
    'autoria. Nenhum livro é produzido individualmente,',
    'como sabes., E é verdade o que diz o livro?',
    '- Como descrição é. O programa que',
    'estabelece é insensato. O entesouramento',
    'secreto da sabedoria. a propagação',
    'gradual do esclarecimento. por fim uma',
    'rebelião proletária. a derribada do',
    'Partido. Tu mesmo previste o que ele diria.',
    'é tudo bobagem. Os proletários nunca',
    'se revoltarão, em mil anos, ou num milhão',
    'de anos., Não podem. Não preciso dizer-te',
    'a razão: já a conheces. Se algum dia',
    'acariciaste sonhos de insurreição violenta,',
    'deves abandoná-los. Não há maneira',
    'de se deitar o Partido abaixo. O domínio',
    'do Partido é eterno. Isso deve ser o ponto',
    'de partida dos teus pensamentos. Aproximou-se',
    'mais da cama., Eterno!, repetiu., E agora,',
    'voltemos à questão do como e do por que.',
    'Compreendes bem como o Partido se mantém',
    'no poder. Agora, dize-me, porque nos agarramos',
    'ao poder. Qual é o nosso motivo? Por que',
    'devemos querer o poder? Vamos, fala, acrescentou,',
    'vendo que Winston calava. Não obstante,',
    'Winston continuou calado por mais alguns',
    'instantes. Dominara-o uma profunda sensação',
    'de cansaço. Voltara ao rosto de O\'Brien',
    'o débil e dôido lampejo de entusiasmo.',
    'Ele sabia de antemão o que diria ó\'Brien.',
    'Que o Partido não buscava o poder em seu',
    'próprio benefício, mas pelo bem da maioria.',
    'Que procurava o poder porque os homens da',
    'massa eram criaturas débeis e covardes',
    'que não podiam suportar a liberdade nem',
    'enfrentar a verdade, e que deviam ser dominados',
    'e sistemàticamente defraudados por outros,',
    'mais fortes que eles. Que para o gênero',
    'humano a alternativa era liberdade ou felicidade',
    'e que, para a grande maioria, era preferível',
    'a felicidade. Que o Partido era o eterno',
    'guardião dos fracos, uma seita dedicada',
    'fazendo o mal para que o bem pudesse reinar,',
    'sacrificando sua própria felicidade à',
    'felicidade alheia. O terrível, raciocinou',
    'Winston, o terrível era que, dizendo isso,',
    'O\'Brien estaria sendo sincero. Via-se- lhe',
    'na fisiononiia. O\'Brien sabia tudo. Mil vezes',
    'melhor que Winston, sabia como o mundo era,',
    'na realidade, em que degradação vivia',
    'a massa dos seres humanos e por ráeio de',
    'que mentiras e barbaridades o Partido os',
    'mantinha nesse nível. Compreendia tudo,',
    'pesava-o, e não fazia diferença: era',
    'tudo justificado pelo intuito derradeiro.',
    'Que podes fazer, pensou Winston, contra o',
    'lunático que é mais inteligente que tu,',
    'que ouve equânime os teus argumentos e',
    'simplesmente persiste na sua loucura?, Vós',
    'nos governais em nosso próprio benefício',
    '- disse, com um fio de voz., Acreditais',
    'que os seres humanos não têm capacidade',
    'para se governar e porisso. Deu um estremeção',
    'e quase gritou. Uma descarga dolorosa lhe',
    'percorrera o corpo. O\'Brien levara ao trinta',
    'e cinco o ponteiro do aparelho., Isso foi',
    'cretino, Winston, cretino! Bem sabes que',
    'não devias dizer uma coisa dessas. Levou',
    'a alavanca à posição neutra e continuou:',
    '- Eu responderei minha pergunta. O Partido',
    'procura o poder por amor ao poder. Não',
    'estamos interessados no bem-estar alheio;',
    'só estamos interessados no poder. Nem na',
    'riqueza, nem no luxo, nem em longa vida de',
    'prazeres: apenas no poder, poder puro. O',
    'que significa poder puro já compreenderás,',
    'daqui a pouco. Somos diferentes de todas',
    'as oligarquias do passado, porque sabemos',
    'o que estamos fazendo. Tôdas as outras,',
    'até mesmo as que se assemelhavam conosco,',
    'eram covardes e hipócritas. Os nazistas',
    'alemães e os comunistas russos muito se',
    'aproximaram de nós nos métodos, mas nunca',
    'tiveram a coragem de reconhecer os próprios',
    'motivos. Fingiam, talvez até acreditassem,',
    'ter tomado o poder sem querer, e por tempo',
    'limitado, e que bastava dobrar a esquina',
    'para entrar num paraíso onde os seres humanos',
    'seriam iguais e livres. Nós não somos',
    'assim. Sabemos que ninguém jamais toma',
    'o poder com a intenção de largá-lo.',
    'O poder não é um meio, é um fim em',
    'si. Não se estabelece uma ditadura com',
    'o fito de salvaguardar uma revolução;',
    'faz-se a revolução para estabelecer a',
    'ditadura. O objetivo da perseguição é',
    'a perseguição. O objetivo da tortura',
    'é a tortura. O objetivo do poder é o',
    'poder. Agora começas a me compreender?',
    'Winston ficou admirado, como já ficara',
    'antes, pelo cansaço do rosto de O\'Brien.',
    'Era forte, carnudo e brutal, cheio de inteligência',
    'e de uma espécie de paixão controlada',
    'diante da qual ele se sentia inerme; mas',
    'estava cansado. Tinha olheiras fundas, e',
    'as bochechas estavam flácidas. O\'Brien',
    'inclinou-se sobre ele, aproximando de propósito',
    'a cara gasta., Estás pensando que meu',
    'rosto está velho e cansado. Estás pensando',
    'que falo do poder, e no entanto não consigo',
    'deter a deterioração do meu próprio',
    'corpo. Não podes compreender, Winston,',
    'que o indivíduo é apenas uma célula?',
    'O cansaço da célula é o vigor do organismo.',
    'Acaso morres quando aparas as unhas? Afastando-se',
    'da cama e pôs-se a passear de um lado para',
    'outro, com a mão na algibeira., Somos',
    'os sacerdotes do poder, disse., Deus é',
    'poder. Mas no momento, para ti, poder é',
    'apenas uma palavra. é tempo de teres uma',
    'idéia do que significa poder. A primeira',
    'coisa que deves entender é que o poder',
    'é coletivo. O indivíduo só tem poder',
    'na medida em que cessa de ser indivíduo.',
    'Conheces o lema do Partido: "Liberdade é',
    'Escravidão." Já te ocorreu que é reversível?',
    'Escravidão é liberdade. Sózinho, livre,',
    'o ser humano é sempre derrotado. Assim',
    'deve ser, porque todo ser humano está condenado',
    'a morrer, que é o maior dos fracassos.',
    'Mas se puder realizar uma submissão completa,',
    'total, se puder fugir à sua identidade,',
    'se puder fundir-se no Partido então ele',
    'é o Partido, e é onipotente e imortal.',
    'A segunda coisa que deves entender é que',
    'poder é o poder sobre todos os entes humanos.',
    'Sobre o corpo mas, acima de tudo, sobre a',
    'mente. O poder sobre a matéria, realidade',
    'externa, como a chamarias, não é importante.',
    'E o nosso poder sobre a matéria já é',
    'absoluto. Por um momento, Winston ignorou',
    'o mostrador. Fez um violento esfôrço',
    'para se sentar, e só conseguiu torcer o',
    'corpo dolorosamente., Mas como podes controlar',
    'a matéria?, explodiu., Não consegues',
    'nem dominar o clima nem a lei da gravidade.',
    'E há a doença, a morte, a dor. O\'Brien',
    'calou-o com um gesto., Controlamos a matéria',
    'porque controlamos a mente. A realidade está',
    'dentro da cabeça. Aprenderás aos poucos,',
    'Winston. Não há nada que não possamos',
    'fazer. Invisibilidade, levitação. ..',
    'tudo. Eu poderia flutuar no ar, como uma',
    'bolha de sabão, se quisesse. Mas não',
    'quero, porque o Partido não o deseja. Deves',
    'abandonar essas idéias século dezenove',
    'a respeito das leis da Natureza. Nós fazemos',
    'as leis da natureza! Não fazeis! Não',
    'sois donos do planeta. E a Eurásia e a',
    'Lestásia? Ainda não as vencestes. -Não',
    'importa. Haveremos de dominá-las quando',
    'nos convir. E se não, que diferença faz?',
    'Podemos bani-las da exístencia. A Oceania',
    'é o mundo., Mas se o mundo não passa',
    'dum grão de pó! E o homem é minúsculo',
    '- inerme! Há quanto tempo existe? Durante',
    'milhões de anos a terra foi desabitada.',
    '- Tolice. A terra é tão velha quanto',
    'o homem, e nada mais. Como poderia ser mais',
    'velha? Nada existe exceto pela via da consciência',
    'humana., Mas as rochas estão cheias de',
    'ossos de animais extintos, mamutes, mastodontes,',
    'e répteis enormes que viveram aqui muito',
    'antes do homem aparecer., Já viste êsses',
    'ossos, Winston? Naturalmente não. Os biólogos',
    'do século dezenove os inventaram. Antes',
    'do homem, não havia nada. Depois do homem,',
    'se por acaso acabasse, nada haveria. Fóra',
    'do homem não há nada., Mas o universo',
    'inteiro está fora de nós. Considera as',
    'estrelas. Algumas estão a um milhão de',
    'anos-luz de distância. Estão para sempre',
    'fora de nosso alcance., Que são estrelas?',
    '- indagou O\'Brien, indiferente., São pedacinhos',
    'de fogo a alguns quilômetros de distância.',
    'Poderíamos alcançá-las, se quiséssemos.',
    'Ou poderíamos apagá- las. A terra é',
    'o centro do universo. O sol e as estrêlas',
    'giram em tôrno dela. Winston fez outro',
    'movimento convulso. Desta vez porém não',
    'disse nada. O\'Brien continuou, como se respondesse',
    'a uma objeção falada:, Naturalmente,',
    'isso não é verdade, para certos propósitos.',
    'Quando navegamos no oceano, ou quando predizemos',
    'um eclipse, muita vez nos convém supor',
    'que a terra rode em tôrno do sol e que',
    'as estrêlas estão a milhões e milhões',
    'de quilômetros de distância. E daí?',
    'Imaginas que não podemos produzir um sistema',
    'dual de astronomia? As estrêlas podem estar',
    'longe ou perto, conforme precisarmos. Supões',
    'que os nossos matemáticos não dão conta',
    'do recado? esqueceste do duplipensar? Winston',
    'encolheu-se na cama. Dissesse o que dissesse,',
    'a pronta resposta esmagava-o como uma paulada.',
    'E no entanto sabia, sabia que tinha razão.',
    'A teoria de que nada existe fora da mente',
    'humana, com certeza havia um meio de demonstrá-la',
    'falsa? Não fora denunciada e provada falsa,',
    'havia muito tempo? Isso até tinha um nome,',
    'que ele esquecera. Um vago sorriso animou',
    'as comissuras dos lábios de O\'Brien, que',
    'voltara a fitá-lo:, Eu te disse, Winston,',
    'que a metafísica não era o teu forte.',
    'A palavra que estás procurando encontrar',
    'é "solipsismo". Mas estás enganado. Não',
    'é solipsismo. Solipsismo coletivo, se quiseres.',
    'Mas é diferente: na verdade, é o oposto.',
    'Tudo isto não passa de digressão, acrescentou,',
    'em tom mudado., O verdadeiro poder, o poder',
    'pelo qual temos de lutar dia e noite, não',
    'é o poder sobre as coisas, mas sobre os',
    'homens., Fez uma pausa e por um momento',
    'tornou a assumir o ar de mestre-escola interrogando',
    'o aluno esperto:, Como é que um homem',
    'afirma o seu poder sobre outro, Winston?',
    'Winston refletiu., Fazendo-o sofrer., Exatamente.',
    'Fazendo-o sofrer. A obediência não basta.',
    'A menos que sofra, como podes ter certeza',
    'de que ele obedece tua vontade e não a',
    'dele? O poder reside em infligir dor e humilhação.',
    'O poder está em se despedaçar os cérebros',
    'humanos e tornar a juntá-los da forma que',
    'se entender. Começas a distinguir que tipo',
    'de mundo estamos criando? é exatamente',
    'o contrário das estúpidas utopias hedonísticas',
    'que os antigos reformadores imaginavam. Um',
    'mundo de medo, traição e tormento, um',
    'mundo de pisar ou ser pisado, um mundo que',
    'se tornará cada vez mais impiedoso, à',
    'medida que se refina. O progresso em nosso',
    'mundo será o progresso no sentido de maior',
    'dor. As velhas civilizações proclamavam-se',
    'fundadas no amor ou na justiça. A nossa',
    'funda-se no ódio. Em nosso mundo não',
    'haverá outras emoções além do medo,',
    'fúria, triunfo e auto- degradação.',
    'Destruiremos tudo mais, tudo. Já estamos',
    'liquidando os hábitos de pensamento que',
    'sobreviveram de antes da Revolução. Cortamos',
    'os laços entre filho e pai, entre homem',
    'e homem, entre mulher e homem. Ninguém',
    'mais ousa confiar na espôsa, no filho ou',
    'no amigo. Mas no futuro não haverá espôsas',
    'nem amigos. As crianças serão tomadas',
    'das mães ao nascer, como se tiram os ovos',
    'da galinha. O instinto sexual será extirpado.',
    'A procreação será uma formalidade anual',
    'como a renovação de um talão de racionamento.',
    'Aboliremos o orgasmo. Nossos neurologistas',
    'estão trabalhando nisso. Não haverá',
    'lealdade, exceto lealdade ao Partido. Não',
    'haverá amor, exceto amor ao Grande Irmão.',
    'Não haverá riso, exceto o riso de vitória',
    'sobre o inimigo derrotado. Não haverá',
    'nem arte, nem literatura, nem ciência.',
    'Quando formos onipotentes, não teremos',
    'mais necessidade de ciência. Não haverá',
    'mais distinção entre a beleza e a feiura.',
    'Não haverá curiosidade, nem fruição',
    'do processo da vida. Todos os prazeres concorrentes',
    'serão destruidos. Mas sempre. não te',
    'esqueças, Winston. sempre haverá a',
    'embriaguez do poder, constantemente crescendo',
    'e constantemente se tornando mais sutil.',
    'Sempre, a todo momento, haverá o gôzo',
    'da vitória, a sensação de pisar um',
    'inimigo inerme. Se queres uma imagem do futuro,',
    'pensa numa bota pisando um rosto humano -',
    'para sempre. Fez uma pausa, como esperando',
    'que Winston falasse. Winston de novo tentara',
    'se encolher sobre a cama. Não podia dizer',
    'nada. Seu coração parecia gelado. O\'Brien',
    'continuou:, E lembra-te de que é para',
    'sempre. O rosto estará sempre ali para',
    'ser pisado. O herege, o inimigo da sociedade,',
    'ali estará sempre, para ser sempre derrotado',
    'e humilhado. Tudo que sofreste desde que',
    'estás em nossas mãos, tudo continuará,',
    'e pior. A espionagem, as traições, as',
    'prisões, as torturas, as execuções,',
    'os desaparecimentos jamais cessarão. Será',
    'tanto um mundo de terror quanto de triunfo.',
    'Quanto mais poderoso o Partido, menos tolerante:',
    'mais débil a oposição ,mais rígido',
    'o despotismo. Goldstein e suas heresias viverão',
    'sempre. Todo dia, a todo momento, serão',
    'derrotados, desacreditados, ridicularizados,',
    'cuspidos, e no entanto sempre sobreviverão.',
    'éste drama que representei contigo durante',
    'sete anos será representado inúmeras',
    'vezes, geração após geração, sempre',
    'em formas mais sutis. Sempre teremos aqui',
    'o herege à nossa mercê, gritando de dor,',
    'quebrado, desprezível, e no fim completamente',
    'arrependido, salvo de si próprio, rastejando',
    'aos nossos pés por sua própria vontade.',
    'é êsse o mundo que estamos preparando,',
    'Winston, um mundo de vitória após vitória,',
    'de triunfo sobre triunfo sobre triunfo: infinda',
    'pressão, pressão, pressão sobre o nervo',
    'do poder. Vejo que começas a perceber o',
    'que será o mundo. Mas no fim farás mais',
    'do que compreender. Tu o aceitarás, aplaudirás,',
    'farás parte dele. Winston recobrara-se',
    'o suficiente para falar., Não podes! -',
    'disse, dèbilmente., Que queres dizer com',
    'isso?, Não podes criar um mundo como o',
    'que descreveste. é um sonho. é impossível.',
    '- Por que?, é impossível fundar uma',
    'civilização sobre medo, ódio e crueldade.',
    'Nunca poderia durar., Por que não?, Não',
    'teria vitalidade. Desintegrar-se-ia. Suicidarse-ia.',
    'Tolice. \'Tens a impressão de que o ódio',
    'cansa mais que o amor. Por que cansaria mais?',
    'E se cansasse, que diferença faria? Suponhamos',
    'que resolvemos nos gastar mais depressa.',
    'Suponhamos que aceleramos o ritmo da vida',
    'humana, de modo que estamos senis aos trinta',
    'anos. Que diferença faria? Não podes',
    'compreender que a morte do indivíduo não',
    'é morte? O Partido é imortal. Como de',
    'praxe, a voz martelara Winston, mostrando',
    'sua impotência. Além disso, temia que,',
    'se persistisse em discordar, O\'Brien tornasse',
    'a virar o ponteiro. E no entanto não podia',
    'se calar., Dèbilmente, sem argumentos,',
    'sem nada que o apoiasse além do seu horror',
    'inarticulado ao que dissera O\'Brien, voltou',
    'ao ataque., Não sei. não me importa.',
    'De algum modo, haverá de falhar. Algo vos',
    'derrotará. A vida vos derrotará. Nós',
    'controlamos a vida, Winston, em todos os',
    'seus níveis. Imaginas que existe uma coisa',
    'às vezes chamada natureza humana, que se',
    'enfurece como o que fazemos e que se voltará',
    'contra nós. Mas nós criamos a natureza',
    'humana. Os homens são infinitamente maleáveis.',
    'Ou talvez tenhas voltado à velha idéia',
    'de que os proletários ou os escravos se',
    'levantarão e nos derrubarão. Perde a',
    'esperança. São inermes, como os animais.',
    'A humanidade é o Partido. Os outros estão',
    'de fora. .. não contam., Não me importa.',
    'No fim haverão de vos derrotar. Mais cedo',
    'ou mais tarde verão o que sois, e então',
    'vos estraçalharão., Vês algum sinal',
    'de que isso aconteça? Alguma razão para',
    'que aconteça?, Não. é o que acredito.',
    'Sei que falhareis. Há algo no universo',
    '- não sei o que, um espírito, um princípio',
    '- que nunca podereis vencer. Acreditas em',
    'Deus, Winston? Não. Então o que é êsse',
    'princípio que nos derrotará? Não sei.',
    'O espírito do Homem. E tu te consideras',
    'homem? Sim. Se és homem, Winston, és',
    'o último homem. Tua raça está extinta.',
    'Nós somos os herdeiros. Entendes que estás',
    'sózinho? Estás fora da história, tu',
    'és não-existente., Seus modos mudaram',
    'e ele disse, mais brusco:, E te consideras',
    'moralmente superior a nós, com nossas mentiras',
    'e nossa crueldade?, Sim, eu me considero',
    'superior. O\'Brien não falou. Duas outras',
    'vozes falavam. Dali a um momento, Winston',
    'reconheceu como sua uma delas. Era uma gravação',
    'da conversa que tivera com O\'Brien, na noite',
    'em que se ligara à Fraternidade. Ouviu-',
    'se prometendo mentir, roubar, forjar, assassinar,',
    'incentivar a toxicomania e a prostituição,',
    'a disseminação de doenças venéreas,',
    'atirar vitríolo no rosto duma criança.',
    'O\'Brien teve um pequeno gesto de impaciência,',
    'como se dissesse que mal valia a pena fazer',
    'a demonstração. Ele apertou um botão',
    'e as vozes calaram-se., Levanta-te dessa',
    'cama, ordenou. Os laços se haviam afrouxado.',
    'Winston alcançou o chão com os pés',
    'e levantou-se titubeando., és o último',
    'homem, disse O\'Brien., és o guardião',
    'do espirito humano. Já verás que aspecto',
    'tens. Despe-te. Winston desamarrou o barbante',
    'que servia de cinto ao macacão. Havia muito',
    'tempo que se fora o zip, violentamente arrancado.',
    'Não podia se recordar de nenhuma ocasião,',
    'desde que fora preso. em que se despira totalmente.',
    'Por baixo do macacão, tinha o corpo enrolado',
    'em imundos trapos amarelados, mal reconhecíveis',
    'como restos de roupa de baixo. Ao largá-las',
    'no chão, viu que havia no extrêmo do',
    'aposento um jôgo de três espelhos. Aproximou-se',
    'dele e parou de repente. Um grito involuntário',
    'lhe rompeu dos lábios., Anda, disse O\'Brien.',
    '- Cola-te entre os espelhos. Poderás te',
    'ver de lado, como de frente. Ele se detivera',
    'porque estava com medo. Caminhava ao seu',
    'encontro um espantalho esquelético, curvado',
    'e cinzento. Era a sua aparência que dava',
    'medo, e não apenas o fato de saber que',
    'se tratava dele mesmo. Aproximou-se do cristal.',
    'A cara da criatura parecia se projetar, por',
    'causa do corpo arcado. Uma cara triste de',
    'presidiário, com a testa ossuda se prolongando',
    'pelo crânio calvo, um nariz adunco e zigomas',
    'salientes, acima dos quais os olhos apareciam',
    'vigilantes e ferozes. As faces estavam cobertas',
    'de sulcos, a boca chupada para dentro. Com',
    'certeza, era o seu rosto, mas lhe parecia',
    'ter mudado mais do que mudara por dentro.',
    'As emoções que revelava seriam diferentes',
    'das que sentia. Ficara parcialmente calvo.',
    'A princípio, pensoU que o cabelo agrisalhara',
    'também, mas apenas o couro cabeludo se',
    'tornara cinzento. Com exceção das mãos',
    'e um círculo no rosto, o corpo todo estava',
    'coberto de gafeira antiga, entranhada. Aqui',
    'e ali, sob a sujeira, viam-se cicatrizes',
    'vermelhas de ferimentos, e perto do tornozelo',
    'a variz ulcerada era uma só massa inflamada,',
    'soltando cascas de pele. O que mais aterrorizava',
    'porém era o aspecto geral do corpo. O tórax,',
    'com as costelas de fora, ficara estreito',
    'como o de um esqueleto; as pernas tinham',
    'emagrecido tanto que os joelhos eram mais',
    'grossos que as coxas. Agora percebia o que',
    'O\'Brien tivera em mente ao lhe sugerir que',
    'se visse de lado. Era espantosa a curvatura',
    'da espinha. Os ombros magros arcavam-se para',
    'a frente, formando uma cavidade no peito,',
    'e o pescoço fininho parecia formar um U',
    'sob o peso da cabeça. Se lhe perguntassem,',
    'poderia dizer que se tratava do corpo dum',
    'homem de sessenta anos, vítima duma doença',
    'maligna., Pensaste às vezes, disse O\'Brien',
    '- que minha cara. a cara dum membro do',
    'Partido Interno. parece velha e cansada.',
    'Que achas agora da tua? Agarrou Winston pelos',
    'ombros e fê-lo dar meia volta, de maneira',
    'a fitá-lo de frente., Olha o estado em',
    'que estás! Olha a imundície que recobre',
    'o teu corpo. Olha a sujeira entre teus artelhos.',
    'Olha essa nojenta ferida na tua perna. Sabes',
    'que fedes como um bode? Provàvelmente já',
    'não consegues mais sentí-lo. Olha a tua',
    'magreza. Vês? Com o polegar e o indicador',
    'dou volta ao teu biceps. Poderia quebrar',
    'teu pescoço como se fosse uma cenoura.',
    'Sabes que perdeste vinte e cinco quilos desde',
    'que caíste em nossas mãos? Até o teu',
    'cabelo está caindo aos punhados. Olha!',
    '- Puxou o cabelo de Winston e arrancou um',
    'maço de cabelo., Abre a boca. Nove, dez,',
    'onze dentes restam. Quantos tinhas quando',
    'vieste a nós? E os poucos que te sobram',
    'estão caindo atoa. Olha só! Agarrou um',
    'dos incisivos restantes de Winston com o',
    'polegar e o indicador. Um arrepio de dor',
    'percorreu o maxilar de Winston. O\'Brien arrancara-lhe',
    'o dente pela raiz. Atirou-o ao chão. -',
    'Estás apodrecendo. Estás caindo aos pedaços.',
    'Que és tu? Um saco de lixo. Agora, volta-te',
    'e olha-te de novo no espelho. Vês aquela',
    'coisa te olhando? é o último homem. Se',
    'és humano, a humanidade é aquilo. Agora,',
    'torna a vestir- te. Winston pôs-se a vestir-se',
    'com gestos lentos e rigidos. Até ali não',
    'havia notado como estava magro e fraco. Só',
    'um pensamento lhe agitava a mente: devia',
    'ter estado preso mais tempo do que imaginára.',
    'De repente, fixando os trapos miseráveis',
    'que o vestiam, dominou-o um fundo sentimento',
    'de pena do seu corpo arruinado. Sem saber',
    'o que fazia, deixou-se cair num mocho que',
    'havia junto à cama, e rompeu em pranto.',
    'Sabia da sua feiura, da sua falta de graça,',
    'do feixe de ossos em imunda roupa de baixo,',
    'chorando, sentado sob a luz violenta; mas',
    'não era possível parar. O\'Brien pousou',
    'no seu ombro a mão quase bondosa., Não',
    'durará sempre. Podes fugir disto quando',
    'quiseres. Tudo depende de ti., Tu o fizeste!',
    '- soluçou Winston., Tu me reduziste a',
    'êste estado., Não, Winston. Foste tu',
    'mesmo. Foi o que aceitaste quando te voltaste',
    'contra o Partido. Continha-se tudo no primeiro',
    'ato. Não aconteceu nada que não previsses.',
    'Calou-se por um instante. Depois continuou:',
    '- Nós te batemos, Winston. Nós te vencemos',
    'a resistência. Viste que aspecto tem teu',
    'corpo. Tua mente está no mesmo estado.',
    'Não creio que possa restar muito orgulho',
    'em ti. Foste escoiceado, chibateado e insultado,',
    'gritaste de dor, rolaste no chão, melando-te',
    'no teu sangue e teu vômito. Choramingaste',
    'pedindo misericórdia, traiste todo mundo',
    'e tudo. Podes imaginar alguma degradação',
    'que não te haja acontecido? Winston parára',
    'de chorar, embora as lágrimas ainda brotassem',
    'nos seus olhos. Ergueu a vista para O\'Brien.',
    '- Não traí Júlia. O\'Brien fitou-o contemplativo.',
    '- Não, concordou., Não. é verdade.',
    'Não traiste Júlia. Inundou de novo o',
    'coração de Winston aquela reverência',
    'particular pelo seu torturador, que nada',
    'parecia conseguir extirpar. Como era inteligente,',
    'pensou ele, como era inteligente! O\'Brien',
    'nunca deixava de compreender o que se lhe',
    'dissesse. Qualquer outro no mundo responderia',
    'prontamente que ele traira Júlia. Pois',
    'havia algo que não lhe houvessem arrancado',
    'na tortura? Contara-lhes tudo que sabia a',
    'respeito da moça, seus hábitos, seu caráter,',
    'sua vida passada; confessara até os detalhes',
    'mais insignificantes, tudo quanto acontecera',
    'nos seus encontros, tudo que lhe havia dito',
    'e tudo quanto ela lhe dissera; seus víveres',
    'do mercado negro, seus adultérios, suas',
    'vagas conspiratas contra o Partido. tudo.',
    'E no entanto, no sentido a que se referia,',
    'não a havia traído. Não deixara de',
    'amá-la; seus sentimentos em relação',
    'a ela continuavam na mesma. O\'Brien percebera',
    'o significado de suas palavras sem precisar',
    'explicar., Dize-me, perguntou, quando',
    'me matarão?, Ainda pode demorar muito',
    '- respondeu O\'Brien., és um caso difícil.',
    'Mas não te desesperes. Mais cedo ou mais',
    'tarde todos se curam. No fim te daremos um',
    'tiro. 21 Estava muito melhor. Engordava e',
    'ficava mais forte cada dia, se é que podia',
    'falar de dias. A luz branca e o zumbido eram',
    'os mesmos de sempre, porém a cela era um',
    'pouco mais confortável que as outras em',
    'que estivera. Havia um travesseiro e um colchão',
    'na cama de tábua, e lhe permitiam lavar-se',
    'com certa freqüência na bacia de folha.',
    'Até lhe davam água morna para se lavar.',
    'Haviam fornecido roupa de baixo nova e um',
    'macacão limpo. Tinham pensado a úlcera',
    'com uma pomada. Haviam tirado os restos dos',
    'dentes e lhe dado um jôgo de dentaduras.',
    'Deviam ter passado semanas ou meses. Agora',
    'seria possível marcar a passagem do tempo,',
    'se tivesse interêsse em o fazer, pois o',
    'alimentavam a intervalos aparentemente regulares.',
    'Acreditava que lhe davam três refeições',
    'cada vinte e quatro horas; às vezes, raciocinava',
    'vagamente se as recebia de dia ou de noite.',
    'A comida era surpreendentemente boa, com',
    'carne de três em três refeições.',
    'Certa vez veio até um maço de cigarros.',
    'Não tinha fósforos, porém o guarda',
    'mudo que lhe trazia a comida lhe dava fogo.',
    'Da primeira vez que tentou fumar enjoou muito,',
    'porém perseverou, e fez o maço durar',
    'muito tempo, fumando meio-cigarro após',
    'a refeição. Haviam-lhe dado uma ardósia',
    'branca, com um toco de lapis amarrado à',
    'moldura. A princípio não a usou. Mesmo',
    'quando deSperto sentia-se completamente entorpecido.',
    'Muitas vezes deixava-se ficar na cama de',
    'uma refeição à outra, quase sem se',
    'mexer, ora dormindo, ora mergulhado em vagas',
    'elocubrações durante as quais não valia',
    'a pena abrir os olhos. Havia muito que se',
    'acostumara a dormir com a luz forte no rosto.',
    'Parecia não fazer diferença. à exceção',
    'dos sonhos, que se tornavam mais coerentes.',
    'Sonhava muito, e eram sempre sonhos alegres.',
    'Estava na Terra Dourada, ou então sentado',
    'entre enormes ruinas, gloriosas, banhadas',
    'de sol, em companhia de sua mãe, Júlia,',
    'O\'Brien, sem fazer nada, apenas sentados',
    'ao sol, conversando de coisas pacíficas.',
    'Os pensamentos que tinha quando desperto',
    'eram principalmente relativos aos sonhos.',
    'Parecia ter perdido o poder do esfôrço',
    'intelectual, agora que terminara o estímulo',
    'da dor. Não estava aborrecido; não tinha',
    'o menor desejo de palestra ou distração.',
    'Bastava-lhe estar só, não apanhar nem',
    'ser interrogado, ter bastante que comer e',
    'sentir-se limpo de corpo inteiro. Aos poucos,',
    'ia dormindo menos, porém ainda não sentia',
    'ânimo de se levantar da cama. Tudo que',
    'lhe apetecia era ficar quieto, deitado, sentindo',
    'a fôrça regressar ao corpo. Apalpava-se',
    'aqui e ali, procurando certificar-se de que',
    'não era ilusão o engrossamento dos seus',
    'músculos, o esticamento da pele. Por fim,',
    'constatou sem dúvida que estava engordando;',
    'as coxas estavam positivamente mais grossas',
    'que os joelhos. Depois disso, com relutância',
    'a princípio, começou a fazer exercícios',
    'regulares. Dentro em breve conseguia caminhar',
    'três quilômetros, calculados pelo tamanho',
    'da cela, e os ombros arcados estavam-se endireitando.',
    'Tentou exercícios mais complicados, e ficou',
    'parvo e humilhado de descobrir o que não',
    'podia fazer. O único movimento que podia',
    'fazer era andar; não podia segurar o mocho',
    'com o braço esticado, não podia ficar',
    'numa perna só sem cair. Punha-se de cócoras,',
    'e com dores horríveis na coxa e na barriga',
    'da perna conseguia levantar-se de novo. Deitava',
    'de barriga e tentava erguer-se do chão,',
    'usando as mãos. Inútil; não podia levantar-se',
    'um centímetro que fosse. Mas depois de',
    'alguns dias, mais algumas refeições',
    '- até essa façanha foi possível. Chegou',
    'a ocasião em que o lograva seis vezes seguidas.',
    'Começou a ficar verdadeiramente orgulhoso',
    'do seu corpo, e a acariciar a crença intermitente',
    'de que o rosto também devia estar voltando',
    'ao normal. Só quando por acaso punha a',
    'mão na calva é que se lembrava da face',
    'enrugada, arruinada, que o fitara do espelho.',
    'Sua mente tornou-se mais ativa. Sentava-se',
    'na cama, de costas para a parede e ardósia',
    'nos joelhos, e punha-se a trabalhar, deliberadamente,',
    'na tarefa de se reeducar. Capitulara; não',
    'havia dúvida. Na realidade, percebia agora',
    'que estivera pronto a capitular muito antes',
    'de tomar essa decisão. Desde o momento',
    'em que se encontrara no Ministério do Amor',
    '- e mesmo durante aqueles minutos em que',
    'ele e Júlia haviam esperado, inermes, as',
    'ordens da vóz férrea da teletela, percebera',
    'a frivolidade, a inutilidade da sua tentativa',
    'de levantar-se contra o poder do Partido.',
    'Sabia agora que havia sete anos a Polícia',
    'do Pensamento o vigiara como quem examina',
    'um besouro sob a lupa. Não havia ato físico,',
    'nenhuma palavra em voz alta, que não tivesse',
    'observado, nenhuma associação de idéias',
    'que não tivessem podido inferir. Até',
    'mesmo o grão de poeira esbranquiçada',
    'fora reposto na capa do diário. Tinham',
    'tocado gravações, mostrando fotografias.',
    'Algumas eram fotos de Júlia e dele. Sim,',
    'até de. Não podia mais lutar contra',
    'o Partido. Além disso, o Partido tinha',
    'razão. Devia ter: como poderia enganar-se',
    'o cérebro imortal coletivo? Por que padrão',
    'extra-sensório poderia medir seus raciocínios?',
    'A sanidade era estatística. Era apenas',
    'questão de aprender a pensar como o Partido.',
    'Se ao menos. ! O lápis pareceu-lhe grosso',
    'e desajeitado entre os dedos. Começou a',
    'grafar os pensamentos que lhe vinham à',
    'cabeça. Primeiro escreveu em grandes letras',
    'trêmulas: LIBERDADE é ESCRAVIDãO Depois,',
    'quase sem pausa, escreveu por baixo: DOIS',
    'E DOIS SãO CINCO Houve então uma espécie',
    'de pausa. Sua mente, como se fugisse de alguma',
    'coisa, parecia incapaz de se concentrar.',
    'Sabia que sabia o que vinha depois, mas no',
    'momento não podia se lembrar. Quando se',
    'recordou, foi apenas através do raciocínio',
    'consciente do que deveria ser; não veio',
    'espontâneamente. Escreveu: DEUS é PODER',
    'Aceitava tudo. O passado era alterável.',
    'O passado nunca fora alterado. A Oceania',
    'estava em guerra com a Lestásia. A Oceania',
    'sempre estivera em guerra com a Lestásia.',
    'Jones, Aaronson e Rutherford eram réus',
    'dos crimes imputados. Nunca vira a fotografia',
    'que provava sua inocência. Nunca existira:',
    'ele a inventara. Lembrou-se de que recordara',
    'coisas contraditórias, mas eram apenas',
    'falsas lembranças, produtos de alucinação.',
    'Como tudo era fácil! Bastava render-se',
    'e tudo o mais sobrevinha. Era como nadar',
    'contra uma corrente -que o levasse para trás,',
    'por mais esfôrço que fizesse, e resolveu',
    'de repente dar meia-volta e nadar a favor,',
    'em vez de opôr-se ao fluxo da água. Nada',
    'mudara, exceto sua atitude; e a coisa predestinada',
    'acontecera sempre. Mal sabia porque se havia',
    'revoltado. Tudo era fácil, exceto. !',
    'Qualquer coisa podia ser verdade. Eram tolice',
    'as chamadas leis naturais. Era bobagem a',
    'lei da gravidade. "Se eu quisesse," dissera',
    'O\'Brien, "eu poderia flutuar no ar como uma',
    'bolha de sabão." Winston raciocinara. "Se',
    'ele pensa que flutua no ar, e se eu simultaneamente',
    'pensar que o vejo flutuando, então a coisa',
    'de fato acontece." De repente, como um destroço',
    'submerso que aflora à tona, um pensamento',
    'rompeu- lhe no cérebro: "Não acontece',
    'de fato. Nós é que imaginamos. é uma',
    'alucinação." Fez o pensamento afundar',
    'instantâneamente. Era óbvia sua falácia.',
    'Pressupunha a existência, nalguma parte,',
    'fora do indivíduo, de um mundo "real" onde',
    'coisas "reais" acontecessem. Mas como poderia',
    'existir êsse mundo? Que sabemos das coisas,',
    'exceto através de nossa mente? Tudo que',
    'acontece acontece na cabeça. E o que acontece',
    'em todas as mentes, de fato acontece. Não',
    'teve dificuldade em eliminar a falácia,',
    'e não corria risco de sucumbir. Não obstante,',
    'percebia que não lhe devia ter ocorrido.',
    'O cérebro devia formar um ponto cego sempre',
    'que se apresentasse um pensamento perigoso.',
    'O processo devia ser automático, instintivo.',
    'Crimedeter, era o seu nome em Novilíngua.',
    'Pôs-se a exercitar-se em crimedeter. Apresentava',
    'a si próprio proposições, "o Partido',
    'diz que a terra é plana," "o Partido diz',
    'que o gelo é mais pesado que a água,"',
    '- e treinava para não ver ou não compreender',
    'os argumentos que as contradiziam. Não',
    'era fácil. Necessitava grandes recursos',
    'de raciocínio e improvisação. Os problemas',
    'aritméticos provocados por uma afirmativa',
    'como por exemplo "dois e dois são cinco",',
    'estavam fora da sua compreensão intelectual.',
    'Precisava também de uma espécie de atletismo',
    'da mente, da habilidade de num momento fazer',
    'o uso mais delicado da lógica e, no momento',
    'seguinte, ser inconsciente dos mais brutais',
    'ilogismos. A estupidez era tão necessária',
    'quanto a inteligência, e igualmente difícil',
    'de se conquistar. Durante todo tempo, uma',
    'parte do seu espírito se indagava quando',
    'o matariam. "Tudo depende de ti" dissera',
    'O\'Brien; mas sabia não haver ato consciente',
    'pelo qual aproximasse o fim. Poderia ser',
    'dali a dez minutos, ou dez anos. Poderiam',
    'metê-lo numa solitária, poderiam mandá-lo',
    'a um acampamento de trabalhos forçados,',
    'poderiam soltá-lo algum tempo como às',
    'vezes faziam. Era perfeitamente possível',
    'que antes de ser morto todo o drama da prisão',
    'e do interrogatório fosse representado',
    'de novo. A única coisa certa era que a',
    'morte nunca ocorria no momento esperado.',
    'A tradição, a tradição tácita:',
    'sabia-se, sem nunca se ter ouvido falar dela',
    '- era ser atirado pelas costas: sempre na',
    'nuca, sem aviso, quando o preso ia pelo corredor,',
    'de uma cela a outra. Um dia, mas "um dia"',
    'não era a expressão correta,com toda',
    'a probabilidade era no meio da noite, uma',
    'vez mergulhou num sonho estranho, feliz.',
    'Ia andando pelo corredor, à espera da bala.',
    'Sabia que viria dali a um momento. Tudo estava',
    'resolvido, esclarecido, reconciliado. Não',
    'havia mais dúvidas, nem discussões, nem',
    'dor, nem medo. Sentia o corpo sadio e forte.',
    'Andava com facilidade, com uma alegria de',
    'movimentos, com a sensação de caminhar',
    'ao sol. Não estava mais nos estreitos corredores',
    'brancos do Ministério do Amor, estava na',
    'enorme passagem ensolarada, de um quilômetro',
    'de extensão, em que estivera no seu delírio',
    'intoxicado. Estava na Terra Dourada, seguindo',
    'a senda que cortava o pasto roído de coelhos.',
    'Podia sentir o relvado curto e novo sob os',
    'pés e o sol suave no rosto. Na orla do',
    'campo via os ulmeiros, mexendo-se gentilmente,',
    'e mais além o riacho onde nadavam os mugens',
    'em espraiados verdes sob os chorões. De',
    'repente, levantou-se com um choque de horror.',
    'O suor escorria-lhe pela espinha. Ouvira',
    'a sua própria voz gritando:, Júlia!',
    'Júlia! Júlia, meu amor! Júlia! Por',
    'um momento, teve uma alucinação esmagadora',
    'da sua presença. Ela parecia estar não',
    'apenas com ele, mas dentro dele. Era como',
    'se tivesse penetrado dentro da pele. Naquele',
    'momento, amou-a muito mais do que quando',
    'estavam livres e juntos. Soube também que',
    'ainda estava viva, e precisava de auxílio.',
    'Deitou-se de novo e tentou compor-se. Que',
    'fizera? Quantos anos mais de servidão acrescentara',
    'à sua pena, por aquele momento de fraqueza?',
    'Dali a um momento ouviria o barulho das botas',
    'lá fora. Não era Possível que deixassem',
    'de punir uma explosão daquelas. Saberiam',
    'agora, se já não o soubessem, que estava',
    'rompendo o acôrdo feito. Obedecia ao Partido,',
    'mas ainda o odiava. No passado, ocultara',
    'a mente herética sob a aparência de conformidade.',
    'Agora, recuara mais um passo: na mente recuara,',
    'mas tivera esperança de manter inviolado',
    'o imo do coração. Sabia estar errado,',
    'mas preferia estar errado. eles compreenderiam',
    'isso, O\'Brien o compreenderia. Confessara',
    'tudo naquele grito tolo. Teria de começar',
    'tudo do comêço. Poderia levar anos. Passou',
    'a mão pelo rosto, procurando se familiarizar',
    'com a nova fisionomia. Havia sulcos profundos',
    'nas faces, os zigomas eram salientes, o nariz',
    'se achatara. Além disso, depois de se olhar',
    'no espelho, lhe haviam dado dentadu\'ras novas.',
    'Não era fácil preservar a inescrutabilidade',
    'se nem sabia que feições tinha. De qualquer',
    'modo, não bastava o mero controle fisionômico.',
    'Pela primeira vez viu que para guardar segredo',
    'é preciso escondê-lo também da própria',
    'consciência. Deve-se saber todo o tempo',
    'que o segredo está ali mas, até o momento',
    'de usá-lo, é preciso não permitir que',
    'venha a furo sob nenhuma forma a que se possa',
    'dar nome. Dali por diante, não devia apenas',
    'pensar direito; devia sentir direito, sonhar',
    'direito. E todo o tempo devia guardar o seu',
    'ódio trancado dentro de si, como um corpo',
    'estranho que fosse parte dele e no entanto',
    'desligado do resto do corpo, como uma espécie',
    'de quisto. Um dia resolveriam matá-lo.',
    'Não era possível dizer quando aconteceria,',
    'mas uns segundos antes seria possível adivinhá-',
    'lo. Era sempre por trás, andando pelo corredor.',
    'Dez segundos bastariam. E então, de repente,',
    'sem que se pronunciasse uma palavra, sem',
    'uma interrupção no passo, sem que se',
    'alterasse uma linha do rosto, a camuflagem',
    'cairia de repente e bum! ribombariam as baterias',
    'do seu ódio. O ódio o inundaria como',
    'uma enorme labareda, a roncar. E quase no',
    'mesmo instante bum! viria o tiro, tarde demais,',
    'ou cedo demais. Teriam destruido seu cérebro',
    'antes de recuperá- lo. O pensamento herético',
    'ficaria impune, sem arrependimento, fora',
    'do alcance do seu poder. Teriam esburacado',
    'a própria perfeição. Morrer a odiá-los,',
    'eis a liberdade. Fechou os olhos. Era mais',
    'difícil do que aceitar uma disciplina intelectual.',
    'Era questão de se degradar, de se mutilar.',
    'Tinha de mergulhar na maior imundície.',
    'Que era o mais horrível e nauseante de',
    'tudo? Pensou no Grande Irmão. A face enorme',
    '(por vê-la constantemente nos cartazes,',
    'sempre pensava nela como se tivesse um metro',
    'de largura), com o espesso bigode negro e',
    'os olhos que o seguiam por toda parte, pareceu',
    'penetrar-lhe no cérebro, por si mesma.',
    'Quais eram os seus verdadeiros sentimentos',
    'em relação ao Grande Irmão? Houve um',
    'ruido de botas ferradas no corredor. A porta',
    'de aço abriu-se com estrépito. O\'Brien',
    'entrou na cela. Atrás dele estavam o oficial',
    'de cara de cera e os guardas de uniforme',
    'negro., Levanta. Vem aqui. Winston postou-se',
    'diante dele. O\'Brien pousou as mãos nos',
    'ombros de Winston e fitou-o de perto., Tiveste',
    'idéia de me enganar, disse ele., Foi',
    'uma cretinice. Endireita-te mais. Olha-me',
    'no rosto. Fez uma pausa e continuou, com',
    'tom mais sereno:, Estás melhorando. Intelectualmente,',
    'não há quase nada errado em ti. Só',
    'emocionalmente é que não progrides. Dize-me,',
    'Winston, e lembra-te, nada de mentir; bem',
    'sabes que sempre descubro as mentiras, dize-me,',
    'quais são teus verdadeiros sentimentos',
    'em relação ao Grande Irmão?, Eu o',
    'odeio., Odeias. Bom. Então chegou a hora',
    'de dares o último passo. é preciso que',
    'ames o Grande Irmão. Não basta obedecê-lo:',
    'é preciso amá-lo. Soltou Winston com',
    'um pequeno empurrão na direção dos',
    'guardas., Sala 101, ordenou. 22 A cada',
    'estágio da prisão ele soubera, ou parecera',
    'saber, em que ponto do edificio se encontrava.',
    'Era possível que houvesse ligeira diferença',
    'na pressão do ar. Ficavam no sub- solo',
    'as celas onde os guardas o tinham espancado.',
    'O quarto onde O\'Brien o interrogara era bem',
    'no alto, perto do telhado. O lugar onde estava',
    'ficava muitos metros abaixo do nível do',
    'chão, tão profundo quanto era possível',
    'ir. Era maior do que qualquer das celas em',
    'que estivera. Ele porém mal observou o',
    'ambiente. Tudo que notou foi a existência',
    'de duas pequenas mesas, bem na sua frente,',
    'ambas cobertas de feltro verde. Uma ficava',
    'a apenas um metro ou dois, e a outra mais',
    'longe, perto da porta. Estava amarrado, muito',
    'teso numa cadeira, tão fortemente ligado',
    'que não podia mexer nem a cabeça. Uma',
    'espécie de almofada comprimia-lhe a nuca,',
    'forçando-o a olhar para a frente. Por um',
    'momento ficou só. Depois a porta se abriu',
    'e O\'Brien entrou., Uma vez me perguntaste',
    '- disse O\'Brien, o que havia na Sala 101.',
    'E eu te disse que sabias a resposta. Todos',
    'sabem. O que há na Sala 101 é a piorcoisa',
    'do mundo. A porta tornou a abrir-se. Um guarda',
    'entrou, trazendo algo feito de arame, uma',
    'caixa, ou cesta. Colocou-o na mesa distante.',
    'Por causa da posição ocupada por O\'Brien,',
    'Winston não pôde enxergar bem o que era.',
    '- A pior coisa do mundo, disse O\'Brien -',
    'varia de indivíduo para indivíduo. Pode',
    'ser o sepultamento vivo, a morte pelo fogo,',
    'afogamento, empalamento, ou cinqüenta outras',
    'mortes. Casos há em que é algo trivial,',
    'nem ao menos mortífero. Afastou-se um pouco',
    'para o lado, de modo que Winston pudesse',
    'ver melhor o que estava sobre a mesa. Era',
    'uma gaiola de arame, retangular, com uma',
    'alça em cima. Fixado na frente havia um',
    'objeto que parecia uma máscara de esgrima,',
    'com o lado côncavo para fora. Embora estivesse',
    'a três ou quatro metros de distância,',
    'Winston pôde ver que a gaiola era dividida',
    'longitudinalmente em dois compartimentos,',
    'e que em cada um havia um animal. Eram ratazanas.',
    '- No teu caso, disse O\'Brien, a pior coisa',
    'do mundo são ratos. Uma espécie de tremor',
    'de premonição, um medo de que não tinha',
    'certeza, passara por Winston assim que entrevira',
    'a gaiola. Mas naquele momento, a utilidade',
    'do objeto côncavo de repente se esclareceu.',
    'Suas entranhas pareceram liquefazer-se. Não',
    'podes fazer isso!, exclamou num tom de falsete.',
    'Não podes, não podes! é impossível.',
    'Lembras-te, perguntou OBrien, dos momentos',
    'de pânico que ocorriam nos teus sonhos?',
    'Havia uma muralha de treva na tua frente,',
    'um ronco nos teus ouvidos. Havia algo terrível',
    'do outro lado da parede. Sabias que sabias',
    'o que era, mas não ousavas trazê-lo à',
    'luz. Eram ratos que estavam do outro lado',
    'da muralha., O\'Brien! disse Winston, fazendo',
    'um esfôrço para controlar a voz. Sabes',
    'que isto não é necessário. Que queres',
    'que eu faça? O\'Brien não deu resposta.',
    'Quando falou, foi com os modos de mestre-escola',
    'que às vezes ostentava. Pareceu pensativo,',
    'olhos perdidos na distância, como se se',
    'dirigisse a uma platéia colocada atrás',
    'de Winston., Em si, disse ele, a dor nunca',
    'é suficiente. Há ocasiões em que o',
    'ser humano resiste à dor, mesmo sob risco',
    'de morte. Mas para todos há algo insuportável',
    '- algo que não pode ser contemplado. A',
    'coragem e a covardia nada têm com isso.',
    'Se estás caindo dum lugar alto, não é',
    'covardia agarrar-te a uma corda. Se vens',
    'de águas profundas, não é covardia',
    'encher os pulmões de ar. é apenas um',
    'instinto que não pode ser desobedecido.',
    'é o mesmo com as ratazanas. Para ti, são',
    'insuportáveis. São uma forma de pressão',
    'que não podes aguentar, nem que queiras.',
    'Farás o que se te exige., Mas o que é,',
    'o que é? Como fazê-lo se não sei o',
    'que é? O\'Brien apanhou a gaiola e trouxe-a',
    'para a mesa mais próxima. Colocou-a cuidadosamente',
    'sobre o feltro verde. Winston podia ouvir',
    'o sangue tinindo nas orelhas. Tinha a impressão',
    'de estar na mais absoluta solitude. Encontrava-se',
    'no meio de uma vasta planície erma, um',
    'deZerto plano banhado de sol, e os sons lhe',
    'chegavam de grandes distâncias. No entanto,',
    'a gaiola dos ratos não estava senão a',
    'dois metros dele. Eram ratazanas enormes.',
    'Tinham a idade em que ficam com o focinho',
    'rombudo e o pelo pardo, em vez de cinzento.',
    '- O rato, disse O\'Brien, ainda se dirigindo',
    'à platéia invisível, embora roedor,',
    'é carnívoro. Bem o sabes. Ouviste falar',
    'das coisas que acontecem nos bairros pobres',
    'desta cidade. Em algumas ruas, uma mulher',
    'não ousa deixar o filhinho em casa, por',
    'cinco minutos que seja. é seguro que os',
    'ratos o ataquem. Dentro de muitíssimo pouco',
    'tempo devoram tudo, só deixam ossos. Também',
    'atacam pessoas doentes, e moribundos. Demonstram',
    'espantosa inteligência, descobrindo quando',
    'um ser humano está indefeso. Houve uns',
    'guinchos na gaiola. Pareceram a Winston vír',
    'de muito longe. Os ratos est avam brigando;',
    'tentavam atacar-se através da divisão',
    'de arame. Ouviu também um fundo gemido',
    'de desespêro, que também pareceu vir',
    'de fora. O\'Brien ergueu a gaiola e, ao fazê-lo,',
    'comprimiu algo. Ouviu- se um estalido. Winston',
    'fez um esforço frenético para se livrar',
    'da cadeira. Inútil, pois todo o seu corpo,',
    'inclusive a cabeça, estavam firmemente',
    'presos, imobilizados. O\'Brien aproximou a',
    'gaiola. Estava a menos de um metro do rosto',
    'de Winston., Apertei a primeira alavanca',
    '- disse O\'Brien., Compreendes a construção',
    'desta gaiola. A máscara adapta-se à tua',
    'cabeça, sem deixar saída. Quando eu apertar',
    'esta outra alavanca, a porta da gaiola correrá.',
    'Os monstros famintos saltarão por ela como',
    'balas. Já viste um rato pular no ar? Pularão',
    'sobre teu rosto e começarão a devorá-lo.',
    'às vezes, atacam primeiro os olhos. As',
    'vezes abrem caminho pelas bochechas e devoram',
    'a língua. A gaiola estava mais próxima;',
    'cada vez mais. Winston ouviu uma série',
    'de guinchos agudos que pareciam vir de cima,',
    'de sobre sua cabeça. Mas lutou furiosamente',
    'contra o pânico. Pensar, pensar, mesmo',
    'que lhe restasse uma fração de segundo',
    '- pensar para a única esperança. De repente',
    'o fedor mofado dos brutos atingiu-lhe as',
    'narinas. Dentro dele houve uma violenta convulsão',
    'de náusea, e quase perdeu os sentidos.',
    'Tudo enegrecera. Por um instante, sentiu-',
    'se louco, um animal a gritar. Entretanto,',
    'saiu das trevas trazendo uma idéia. Só',
    'havia um, um único meio de se salvar. Precisava',
    'colocar outro ser humano, interpor o corpo',
    'de outro ser humano diante da gaiola. O círculo',
    'da máscara era suficientemente grande para',
    'tapar a visão de tudo mais. A porta de',
    'arame estava a alguns palmos do seu rosto.',
    'Os ratos sabiam o que ia acontecer. Um deles',
    'dava pulos no ar, e o outro, um escamoso',
    'veterano dos esgotos, se levantou, com as',
    'patas rosadas nas grades, fungando ferozmente.',
    'Winston pôde ver os bigodes e os dentes',
    'amarelos. De novo o pânico negro o possuiu.',
    'Estava cego, indefeso, insano., Um castigo',
    'comum na China imperial, disse O\'Brien,',
    'mais pedagógicamente do que nunca. A máscara',
    'se aproximava. O arame tocou-lhe o rosto.',
    'E então. não, não era alívio, apenas',
    'esperança, um minúsculo fragmento de',
    'esperança. Tarde demais, tarde demais talvez.',
    'Mas compreendera de repente que no mundo',
    'inteiro só havia uma pessoa a quem transferir',
    'seu castigo, um corpo que podia colocar',
    'diante dos ratos. E pôs-se a berrar frenéticamente,',
    'repetidamente:, Faze isso com Júlia! Faze',
    'com Júlia! Comigo não! Júlia! Não',
    'me importa o que faças a ela. Arranca-lhe',
    'a cara, desnuda-lhe os ossos. Não comigo!',
    'Com Júlia! Comigo não! Estava caindo',
    'para trás, vertiginosamente, afastando-se',
    'dos ratos. Ainda estava amarrado à cadeira,',
    'mas caira através do soalho, através',
    'das paredes do edifício, através da terra,',
    'dos oceanos, da atmosfera, do espaço exterior,',
    'no vácuo entre as estrêlas, sempre longe,',
    'longe, longe dos ratos. Estava a uma distância',
    'de anos-luz, porém O\'Brien continuava de',
    'pé ao seu lado. Sentia ainda na face o',
    'toque frio do arame. Mas dentro da escuridão',
    'que o envolvera ouviu outro estalido metálico,',
    'e soube que a porta da gaiola se fechara,',
    'não se abrira. 23 O Café Castanheira',
    'estava quase vazio. Um raio de sol, entrando',
    'em oblíqua pela janela, caia amarelo sobre',
    'as mesas poeirentas. Era a solitária hora',
    'das quinze. Das teletelas escorria uma música',
    'metálica. Winston sentou-se no seu recanto',
    'habitual, fitando o copo vazio. De vez em',
    'quando contemplava um rosto enorme que o',
    'olhava da parede oposta. O GRANDE IRMãO',
    'ZELA POR TI, dizia a legenda. Sem que o chamasse,',
    'o garçon veiu e encheu-lhe o copo de Gin',
    'Vitória, pingando algumas gotas de outra',
    'garrafa com um canudinho atravessando a rolha.',
    'Era sacarina com essência de cravo, a especialidade',
    'do café. Winston escutava a teletela. No',
    'momento, dela apenas saía música, mas',
    'havia a possibilidade de a qualquer momento',
    'divulgar um boletim do Ministério da Paz.',
    'As notícias da frente africana eram extremamente',
    'inquietadoras. O dia todo sentira-se intermitentemente',
    'preocupado com elas. Um exército eurasiano',
    '(a Oceania estava em guerra com a Eurásia:',
    'sempre estivera em guerra com a Eurásia)',
    'progredia para o sul com terrível velocidade.',
    'O boletim do meio-dia não mencionara nenhuma',
    'área definida, mas era provável que a',
    'foz do Congo já fosse um campo de batalha.',
    'Brazzaville e Leopoldville estavam em perigo.',
    'Não era preciso olhar o mapa para saber',
    'o que significava. Não era apenas questão',
    'de perder a áfrica Central: pela primeira',
    'vez em toda a guerra, o território da Oceania',
    'estava ameaçado. Uma violenta emoção,',
    'que não era bem medo, mas uma espécie',
    'de excitação amorfa, se acendeu dentro',
    'dele, e tornou a apagar- se. Deixou de pensar',
    'na guerra. Não podia fixar o pensamento',
    'em assunto algum por mais de uns momentos.',
    'Ergueu o copo e tragou o conteúdo de um',
    'gole. Como sempre, produziu-lhe um arrepio',
    'e até lhe deu engulhos. A bebida era horrível.',
    'Os cravos e a sacarina, em si já bastante',
    'repugnantes, não conseguiam disfarçar',
    'o cheiro oleoso do álcool; e o pior de',
    'tudo era que o bafio de gin, que não o',
    'abandonava dia e noite, misturava-se indissolúvelmente,',
    'no seu espírito, com o cheiro dos. .. Nunca',
    'lhes dizia o nome, nem mesmo em pensamento,',
    'e tanto quanto possível, nunca os visualizava.',
    'Eram algo de que ele só em parte se dava',
    'conta, mexendo-se perto do seu rosto, com',
    'aquele fedor que se prendia às narinas.',
    'Um arroto de gin lhe entreabriu os lábios',
    'escuros. Engordara mais depois de ser posto',
    'em liberdade, e recobrara sua cor antiga',
    '- na verdade, tinha mais cor que antes. Suas',
    'feições haviam engrossado, a pele do',
    'nariz e das faces tornara-se áspera e vermelha,',
    'e até a calva tinha um tom rosa escuro.',
    'Um garçon, sem que ninguém o chamasse,',
    'trouxe um tabuleiro de xadrez e um exemplar',
    'do dia do Times, na página do problema',
    'de xadrez. Daí, vendo vazio o copo de Winston,',
    'trouxe a garrafa de gin e encheu-o. Não',
    'havia necessidade de pedír nada. Conheciam',
    'seus hábitos. O tabuleiro de xadrez estava',
    'sempre à sua espera, sua mesa de canto',
    'sempre reservada; mesmo quando o café estava',
    'cheio ali se sentava a sós, pois ninguém',
    'gostava de ser visto em sua companhia. Nem',
    'mesmo se preocupava de contar quanto bebia.',
    'A intervalos irregulares apresentavam-lhe',
    'um pedacinho de papel sujo, que passava por',
    'conta, mas tinha a impressão de que sempre',
    'lhe cobravam de menos. Não faria a mínima',
    'diferença se fosse o contr\'ário. Agora',
    'sempre tinha bastante dinheiro. Tinha até',
    'um emprego, uma sinecura, mais bem paga do',
    'que fora o seu trabalho anterior. Parára',
    'a música da teletela, e uma voz a substituira.',
    'Winston levantou a cabeça para escutar.',
    'Não era um boletim da frente, todavia.',
    'Apenas um breve comunicado do Ministério',
    'da Fartura. Aparentemente, no trimestre anterior,',
    'fora superada de noventa e oito por cento',
    'a cota de atacadores para sapatos do Décimo',
    'Plano Trienal. Examinou o problema de xadrez',
    'e arrumou as pedras. Era um final complicado,',
    'com dois bispos. "As brancas jogam. Mate',
    'em dois lances." Winston ergueu os olhos',
    'para o retrato do Grande Irmão. As brancas',
    'sempre matam, pensou, numa espécie de nebuloso',
    'misticismo. Sempre, sem exceção, é',
    'o que acontece. Em nenhum problema de xadrez,',
    'desde o comêço do mundo, as pretas jamais',
    'venceram. Não seria um símbolo do triunfo',
    'eterno, invariável, do Bem sobre o Mal?',
    'A carantonha fitava-o, cheia de calmo poder.',
    'As brancas sempre matam. A voz da teletela',
    'fez uma pausa e acrescentou, num tom diferente,',
    'muito mais grave:, Avisamos que deveis todos',
    'aguardar uma comunicação importante às',
    'quinze e trinta. Quinze e trinta! Notícias',
    'da mais alta importância! Não percais!',
    'Quinze e trinta! E a música metálica',
    'recomeçou. Winston ofegou. Devia ser o',
    'boletim da frente de batalha; o instinto',
    'dizia-lhe que vinham más notícias. O',
    'dia inteiro, com pequenas fases de excitação,',
    'pensara numa esmagadora derrota na áfrica.',
    'Parecia-lhe ver o exército eurasiano formigando,',
    'cruzando a fronteira inviolada e invadindo',
    'a ponta da áfrica como uma coluna de saúvas.',
    'Por que não fora possível franqueá-lo',
    'de algum modo? A silhueta da costa ocidental',
    'da áfrica destacou-se vividamente na sua',
    'mente. Apanhou o bispo branco e colocou-o',
    'num dos quadros. Ali estava a casa certa.',
    'Ao mesmo tempo que enxergava a horda negra',
    'disparando para o sul, via outra fôrça,',
    'misteriosamente reunida, súbitamente plantada',
    'na sua retaguarda, cortando-lhe as comunicações',
    'por terra e mar. Sentiu que, pensando nela,',
    'estava dando existência àquela outra',
    'fôrça. Mas era necessário agir ràpidamente.',
    'Se pudessem assumir o controle da áfrica',
    'inteira, se tivessem campos de pouso e bases',
    'de submarinos no Cabo, cortariam a Oceania',
    'em duas. Poderia significar qualquer coisa:',
    'derrota, debacle, redivisão do mundo, destruição',
    'do Partido! Ele respirou fundo. Lutava dentro',
    'dele uma extraordinária miscelânea de',
    'sentimentos, mas não era uma miscelânea,',
    'própriamente; mais uma sucessão de camadas',
    'de sentimento, e era impossível dizer qual',
    'ficava por baixo. Passou o espasmo. Tornou',
    'a recolocar o bispo no lugar anterior, mas',
    'por um instante não pôde dedicar-se ao',
    'estudo sério do problema de xadrez. Seus',
    'pensamentos tornaram a vaguear. Quase inconsciente,',
    'pôs-se a rabiscar com o dedo na poeira',
    'da mesa: 2+2-5, Não podem ver dentro de',
    'ti, dissera ela. Mas, podíam entrar na',
    'pessoa., O que te acontecer aqui será',
    'para sempre, dissera O\'Brien. E era verdade.',
    'Havia coisas, atos do indivíduo, dos quais',
    'era impossível se recuperar. Algo estava',
    'morto em seu peito; queimado, cauterizado.',
    'Ele a vira; chegara até a falar-lhe. Não',
    'havia perigo nisso. Sabia, quase instintivamente,',
    'que agora não se interessavam mais pelo',
    'que fizesse. Poderiam ter combinado novos',
    'encontros, se algum dos dois o tivesse desejado.',
    'Na verdade, haviam-se encontrado por acaso.',
    'Foi no parque, num dia feio e hostil de março,',
    'quando a terra era como ferro, toda a relva',
    'parecia morta e não havia flor em parte',
    'alguma, exceto alguns crocus que se haviam',
    'arriscado a ser despetalados pelo vento.',
    'Ele ia andando depressa, as mãos geladas,',
    'olhos lacrimejantes, quando a viu a menos',
    'de dez metros de distância. Imediatamente',
    'percebeu que ela mudara, de modo mal definido.',
    'Quase se cruzaram sem um gesto; mas ele voltou-se',
    'e seguiu-a, sem grande interêsse. Sabia',
    'não haver perigo, já ninguém se ocupava',
    'dele. Ela não falou. Caminhara obliquamente,',
    'pela grama, como se tentasse se desvencilhar',
    'dele; depois parecera resignar-se a tê-lo',
    'ao lado. Dali a pouco estavam no meio duma',
    'touceira de arbustos desfolhados e escalavrados,',
    'que não serviam nem como esconderijo nem',
    'como abrigo contra o vento. Pararam. Fazia',
    'um frio nefando. O vento assobiava por entre',
    'os galhos secos, e sacudia os pobres crocus',
    'sujos. Ele passou o braço pela cintura',
    'da moça. Não havia teletela, mas devia',
    'haver microfones escondidos; além disso,',
    'podiam ser vistos. Não importava, nada',
    'importava. Poderiam deitar no chão e fazer',
    'aquilo se quisessem. Sua carne gelou de horror,',
    'só de pensá-lo. Ela não reagiu de modo',
    'algum ao toque do braço de Winston; nem',
    'ao menos tentou se livrar. Ele soube então',
    'o que havia mudado nela. Tinha o rosto macilento,',
    'e havia uma longa cicatriz, parcialmente',
    'oculta pelo cabelo, rasgando a testa e a',
    'fonte; mas não era essa a mudança. Sua',
    'cintura engrossara e, de modo surpreendente,',
    'enrijara também. Ele lembrou-se de um a',
    'vez em que, após a explosão de uma bombafoguete,',
    'ajudara a puxar um cadáver debaixo dos',
    'escombros, e como se assustara não apenas',
    'com o peso incrível do corpo como também',
    'com a rigidez e a dificuldade de segurálo,',
    'que davam mais a impressão de pedra do',
    'que de carne. O corpo dela dava aquela impressão.',
    'Ocorreu-lhe que a textura de sua pele também',
    'era muito diferente do que fora. Não tentou',
    'beijá-la, nem falaram. Enquanto atravessavam',
    'o portão, de volta, ela olhou-o de frente',
    'pela primeira vez. Foi apenas um olhar momentâneo,',
    'cheio de desprezo e repugnância. Ele indagou',
    'de si mesmo se se tratava de uma repugnancia',
    'oriunda do passado ou se inspirada também',
    'pelo seu rosto inchado e a água que o vento',
    'persistia em fazerlhe brotar dos olhos. Tinham',
    'sentado em duas cadeiras de ferro, de lado',
    'mas não muito juntas. Viu que Júlia estava',
    'a pique de falar. Ela esticou alguns centímetros',
    'o pé no sapato deselegante e deliberadamente',
    'quebrou um graveto. Ele observou que os pés',
    'da moça pareciam ter-se alargado., Eu',
    'te traí, disse ela, sem rodeios., Eu',
    'te traí, disse ele também. Júlia lançou-lhe',
    'outro olhar de repugnância., As vezes,',
    '- disse ela, ameaçam a gente com uma coisa.',
    'com coisas que não se pode aguentar, não',
    'se pode nem pensar. E então a gente diz',
    '"Não faças isso comigo, faze com outra',
    'pessoa, faze com Fulano e Sicrano." Mais',
    'tarde, talvez finjas que se tratava apenas',
    'de um estratagema, mandar que o fizessem',
    'a outro, e que não era a sério. Mas não',
    'é verdade. Na hora que acontece a gente',
    'fala sério. Pensa que não há outro',
    'jeito de se salvar; e se dispõe a salvar-se',
    'daquele modo. A gente quer que a coisa aconteça',
    'ao outro. Não se importa que sofra. Só',
    'importa a gente. Só nós temos importância.',
    '- Só nós temos importância, repetiu',
    'ele., E depois disso, já não se sente',
    'o mesmo pela outra pessoa., Não, concordou',
    'ele, já não se sente o mesmo. Não',
    'parecia haver nada mais a dizer. O vento',
    'colava-lhes à pele os macacões delgados.',
    'Quase imediatamente, tornou-se incômodo',
    'ficar ali, calados: além disso, estava',
    'frio demais para continuarem sem se mexer.',
    'Ela disse qualquer coisa a respeito do trem',
    'subterrâneo e levantou-se.. ., Precisamos',
    'nos encontrar outra vez, disse ele., Sim,',
    'precisamos nos encontrar. Seguiu-a irresoluto',
    'por alguma distância, meio passo atrás.',
    'Não tornaram a falar. Ela não procurou',
    'se desvencilhar dele, porém andava com',
    'passo bastante rápido, de maneira a evitar',
    'que a alcançasse. Ele resolvera acompanhá-la',
    'até a estação do subterrâneo, mas',
    'de repente essa coisa de seguir uma pessoa',
    'lhe pareceu insuportável e inútil. Dominou-o',
    'o desejo não tanto de se afastar de Júlia',
    'como de voltar ao Castanheira, que nunca',
    'lhe parecera tão atraente como naquele',
    'instante. Teve uma visão saudosa da sua',
    'mesinha no canto, com o jornal, o tabuleiro',
    'de xadrez e o copo sempre cheio de gin. Sobretudo,',
    'não faria frio. No instante seguinte, e',
    'não por acaso, ele permitiu que um grupo',
    'de pessoas o separasse dela. Fez uma tentativa',
    'desanimada de alcançá-la, depois reduziu',
    'o passo, voltou-se e saiu na direção',
    'oposta. Depois de ter caminhado uns cinqüenta',
    'metros, voltou-se e olhou para trás. A',
    'rua não estava cheia, mas quase não a',
    'podia distinguir. Podia ser qualquer daquelas',
    'figuras apressadas. Talvez o corpo engrossado',
    'e enrijado não fôsse mais reconhecível',
    'por trás. "Na hora que acontece a gente',
    'fala sério", dissera ela. Ele falara sério.',
    'Não apenas o dissera: desejara-o. Desejara',
    'que ela e não ele sofresse os. Algo se',
    'modificou na música que escorria da teletela.',
    'Doniinava-a, partida e zombeteira, uma nota',
    'amarela. E então, talvez não estivesse',
    'acontecendo, talvez fosse apenas uma lembrança',
    'tomando forma de som, uma voz cantou: "Sob',
    'a frondosa castanheira Eu te vendi e tu me',
    'vendeste. . . Os olhos de Winston ficaram',
    'rasos dágua. Um garçon que passava observou',
    'o copo vazio e voltou com a garrafa de gin.',
    'Ele ergueu o copo e cheirou-o. Quanto mais',
    'bebia, mais horrível se tornava a tisana.',
    'Mas tornara-se o elemento em que nadava.',
    'Era sua vida, sua morte, sua ressurreição.',
    'Era o gin que o mergulhava no estupor todas',
    'as noites, e o gin que o revigorava todas',
    'as manhãs. Ao despertar, rara vez antes',
    'das onze, as pálpebras coladas, a boca',
    'ardente e as costas moídas, seria impossível',
    'abandonar a horizontal se não fossem a',
    'garrafa e a xícara no criado-mudo. Passava',
    'um par de horas sentado, olhos vazios e vidrados,',
    'garrafa à mão, escutando a teletela.',
    'Das quinze à hora de fechar estava sempre',
    'no Castanheira. Ninguém mais se importava',
    'com o que ele fizesse, nenhum apito o acordava,',
    'nenhuma teletela o admoestava. Ocasionalmente,',
    'duas vezes por semana talvez, ia a um empoeirado',
    'e esquecido escritório do Ministério',
    'da Verdade e trabalhava um pouco. Fôra',
    'nomeado para o sub-comitê de um sub-comitê',
    'que surgira de um dos inúmeros comitês',
    'que tratavam das dificuldades menores aparecidas',
    'durante a compilação da Décima Primeira',
    'Edição do Dicionário de Novilíngua.',
    'Cabia-lhes redigir um chamado Relatório',
    'provisório, porém ele nunca descobrira',
    'a respeito do que deveriam es\'crever. Parecia',
    'ligar-se à questão da colocação das',
    'vírgulas antes ou depois das aspas. Havia',
    'outros quatro no comité, todos pessoas',
    'em semelhantes condições. Havia dias',
    'em que se reuniam e logo debandavam de novo,',
    'admitindo francamente que na verdade nada',
    'tinham que fazer. Mas noutras ocasiões,',
    'atiravam-se ao trabalho quase com ânsia,',
    'fazendo uma fita enorme de minutar seus relatórios',
    'pessoais e redigir longos memorandos que',
    'nunca terminavam, quando a discussão sobre',
    'o que deveriam discutir se tornava extraordinàriamente',
    'complicada e abstrusa, com sutis divergências',
    'sobre definições, enormes digressões,',
    'brigas e até ameaças de recurso a autoridade',
    'superior. E então de repente o entusiasmo',
    'se apagava e eles ficavam em tôrno da',
    'mesa, entrefitando-se, com olhos defuntos,',
    'como duendes que se desvanecem ao cocoricar',
    'do galo. A teletela calou-se um instante.',
    'Winston tornou a levantar a cabeça. O boletim!',
    'Mas não, apenas mudavam de música. Tinha',
    'o mapa da áfrica na retina. O movimento',
    'dos exércitos era um diagrama: uma flecha',
    'negra avançando para o sul, na vertical,',
    'e uma seta branca rasgando para leste, na',
    'horizontal, cortando a haste da primeira.',
    'Como para se tranquilizar, contemplou o rosto',
    'imperturbável do cartaz. Seria concebível',
    'que a segunda flecha nem ao menos existisse?',
    'Seu interêsse caiu de novo. Bebeu novo',
    'gole de gin, apanhou o bispo branco e deu',
    'um lance experimental. Cheque. Evidentemente,',
    'porém, não era o lance certo porque.',
    'Sem que a chamasse, uma lembrança lhe voltou',
    'à mente. Viu um quarto iluminado a vela,',
    'com uma vasta cama, coberta por uma colcha',
    'branca, e ele próprio, com nove ou dez',
    'anos, sentado no chão, sacudindo um copo',
    'de dados e rindo-se nervosamente. Sua mãe',
    'estava sentada à sua frente e também',
    'ria. Devia ter sido um mês antes dela desaparecer.',
    'Fôra um momento de reconciliação, em',
    'que esquecera a fome atenazante no ventre,',
    'e ressuscitara parcialmente a antiga afeição,',
    'Lembrava-se lúcidamente do dia, de chuva',
    'forte, em que a água escorría pelas vidraças',
    'e dentro da casa estava escuro demais para',
    'ler. Tornara-se insuportável o tédio',
    'das duas crianças presas num quarto escuro',
    'e apertado. Winston queixava-se e resmungava,',
    'fazia fúteis pedidos de comida, perambulava',
    'nervoso pelo quarto tirando tudo do seu lugar',
    'e dando pontapés nas paredes até os vizinhos',
    'reclamarem, dando murros do outro lado; enquanto',
    'isso, a menina gemia intermitentemente. No',
    'fim, sua mãe dissera Fica bonzinho que',
    'eu te compro um brinquedo. Um lindo brinquedo.',
    'hás de gostar muito dele." E saíra para',
    'a chuva, indo a uma lojinha próxima que',
    'ainda abria esporàdicamente, e voltara',
    'com uma caixa de papelão contendo um jôgo',
    'de obstáculos. Podia ainda lembrar-se do',
    'cheiro da cartolina molhada. Era um jôgo',
    'paupérrimo. A prancha da corrida de obstáculos',
    'estava rachada, e os dados de madeira eram',
    'tão toscos que mal caíam de lado. Winston',
    'fitara o brinquedo, emburrado, sem interêsse.',
    'Mas então sua mãe acendera um coto de',
    'vela e sentara no chão para jogar. Dali',
    'a pouco ele estava entusiasmado, gritando',
    'e dando gargalhadas quando as pedras subiam',
    'cheias de esperança e caíam nas arapucas,',
    'voltando quase ao ponto de partida. Tinham',
    'jogado oito partidas, ganhando quatro cada',
    'um. A irmãzinha, muito pequena para compreender',
    'o jôgo, fora instalada entre travesseiros',
    'na cama, e ria porque via os outros rindo.',
    'Durante a tarde toda tinham sido felizes',
    'os três, como na primeira infância. Ele',
    'expulsou a cena da memória. Era uma lembrança',
    'falsa. De vez em quando era perturbado por',
    'essas falsas recordações. Não tinha',
    'importância, contanto que soubesse do que',
    'se tratava. Algumas coisas tinham acontecido,',
    'outras não. Concentrou-se de novo no tabuleiro',
    'e tornou a apanhar o bispo branco. Quase',
    'no mesmo instante largou-o com ruido sobre',
    'o tabuleiro. E estremeceu como se lhe tivessem',
    'dado uma alfinetada. Um agudo toque de clarim',
    'cortara o ar. Era o boletim! Vitória! O',
    'toque de clarim antes do noticiário sempre',
    'significava vitória. Uma espécie de arrepio',
    'elétrico percorreu o café. Até os garçons',
    'pararam prestando atenção. O clarim provocara',
    'uma onda de barulho. Já uma voz excitada',
    'tagarelava na teletela, mas antes de começar',
    'fora quase abafada pelos vivas e hurras na',
    'rua. A notícia se propagara como por arte',
    'de magia. Podia-se ouvir apenas o suficiente',
    'do que saía da teletela, para perceber',
    'que tudo acontecera como previra: um vasto',
    'exército transportado pelo mar, secretamente',
    'concentrado, um golpe repentino na retaguarda',
    'do inimigo, a flecha branca cortando a haste',
    'da negra. Fragmentos de frases triunfantes',
    'se faziam ouvir por entre o berreiro geral:',
    '"Vasta manobra estratégica. perfeita',
    'coordenação. derrota integral. meio',
    'milhão de Prisioneiros. completa desmoralização.',
    'controle de toda a áfrica . leva a guerra',
    'a uma distância visível do fim. vitória',
    '. a maior vitória da história humana.',
    'vitória, vitória, vitória! " Sob a',
    'mesa, os pés de Winston fizeram movimentos',
    'convulsos. Não se movera do lugar, porém',
    'mentalmente estava correndo à pressa, misturando-se',
    'com a multidão, vivando até ensurdecer.',
    'Tornou a olhar o retrato do Grande Irmão.',
    'O colosso que dominava o mundo! A rocha contra',
    'a qual as hordas da ásia debalde se haviam',
    'arremessado! Pensou que havia apenas dez',
    'minutos, sim, dez minutos, havia dúvida',
    'em seu coração quanto ao caráter das',
    'notícias da frente de batalha: vitória',
    'ou derrota. Ah, perecera mais que um exército',
    'eurasiano! Muita coisa havia mudado nele,',
    'desde aquele primeiro dia no Ministério',
    'do Amor, porém a transformação final,',
    'salvadora, não se registrara até aquele',
    'momento. A voz da teletela estava ainda falando',
    'de prisioneiros, presa e matança, mas lá',
    'fora a gritaria diminuira um pouco. Os garçons',
    'tinham voltado ao trabalho. Um deles aproximou-se',
    'com a garrafa de gin. Winston, imerso num',
    'sonho bem aventurado, não reparou quando',
    'lhe encheram o copo, Já não corria nem',
    'dava vivas. Estava de volta ao Ministério',
    'do Amor, tudo perdoado, a alma branca de',
    'neve. Estava na tribuna dos réus, confessando',
    'tudo, implicando todos. Ia andando pelo corredor',
    'de ladrilhos brancos, com a impressão de',
    'andar ao sol, acompanhado por um guarda armado.',
    'Por fim penetrava-lhe o crânio a bala tão',
    'esperada. Levantou a vista para o rosto enorme.',
    'Levara quarenta anos para aprender que espécie',
    'de sorriso se ocultava sob o bigode negro.',
    'Oh mal-entendido cruel e desnecessário!',
    'Oh teimoso e voluntário exílio do peito',
    'amantíssimo! Duas lágrimas cheirando',
    'a gin escorreram de cada lado do nariz. Mas',
    'agora estava tudo em paz, tudo ótimo, acabada',
    'a luta. Finalmente lograda a vitória sobre',
    'si mesmo. Amava o Grande Irmão. FIM'
